# Microeconomic Models

>  Microeconomics is the branch of economics that studies the behavior of individual economic agents such as households, firms, and markets. It focuses on how these agents make decisions regarding the allocation of scarce resources and how their interactions determine prices, production, and distribution of goods and services.

| **Law of Demand**                                 | Consumers buy more of a good as its price decreases, ceteris paribus.                        |
| **Marginal Utility and Diminishing Returns**      | Additional satisfaction from consuming more of a good decreases as quantity increases.       |
| **Equilibrium in Competitive Markets**            | Prices adjust to balance supply and demand, leading to efficient allocation of resources.    |
| **Market Power Leads to Deadweight Loss**         | Monopoly pricing reduces total welfare compared to competitive markets.                      |
| **Externalities Cause Market Failure**            | Private markets may under- or over-produce goods when external costs or benefits exist.      |
| **Asymmetric Information Creates Inefficiencies** | Markets can fail when buyers and sellers have unequal information (e.g., adverse selection). |
| **Strategic Behavior Influences Market Outcomes** | Firms and consumers‚Äô decisions depend on expectations of others‚Äô actions (game theory).      |
| **Incentive Compatibility is Key for Contracts**  | Contracts must align incentives to ensure desired behavior from agents.                      |
