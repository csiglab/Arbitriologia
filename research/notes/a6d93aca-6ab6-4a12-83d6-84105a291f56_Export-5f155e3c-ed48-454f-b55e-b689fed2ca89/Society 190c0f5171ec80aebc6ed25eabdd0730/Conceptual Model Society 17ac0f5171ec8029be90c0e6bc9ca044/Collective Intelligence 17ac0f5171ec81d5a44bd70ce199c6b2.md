## Methods of Collective Decision-Making

> **Collective decision-making** involves the process by which a group of individuals makes a choice or reaches a consensus.
> 

Here is a table summarizing various decision-making models along with their descriptions:

| **Decision-Making Model** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Consensus Decision Making** | A model where the group aims to reach a decision everyone can agree on, requiring active participation, dialogue, and compromise. |
| **Majority Rule** | Decisions are made based on the preferences of more than half the members, often seen in democratic systems. |
| **Pluralistic Decision Making** | Allows multiple decisions to coexist within the group, accommodating diverse opinions without forcing a single choice. |
| **Borda Count** | Assigns points to preferences, and the option with the highest cumulative score is chosen. |
| **Preference Aggregation Models** | Various mathematical models, such as the median voter theorem, aggregate individual preferences to determine a collective choice. |
| **Delphi Method** | Iterative and anonymous decision-making process involving a series of surveys and feedback to reach a consensus in a group of experts. |
| **Nominal Group Technique (NGT)** | A structured method involves generating ideas individually, sharing them in a group, and then ranking or voting. |
| **Approval Voting** | Voters can vote for as many candidates as they approve, and the option with the most approvals wins. |
| **Quadratic Voting** | Allows individuals to express the intensity of their preferences by allocating more votes to specific options, providing a more nuanced decision-making process. |
| **Agora Model** | A model based on ancient Greek practices emphasizing deliberation, public discourse, and direct participation in decision-making. |
| **Holacracy** | A decentralized decision-making and organizational governance system that distributes authority across self-organizing teams. |
| **Stakeholder Consultation** | Involves seeking input and feedback from relevant stakeholders before making decisions to ensure inclusivity and consider diverse perspectives. |
| **Expert Decision Making** | A model where individuals or a small group make decisions with specialized knowledge and expertise in a particular domain. |
| **Sequential-Consensual Decision Making** | A process where decisions are made through a series of steps, with consensus sought at each stage, allowing for adjustments based on feedback. |
| **Sociocratic Circle-Organization Method (SCM)** | A governance model emphasizing consent-based decision-making within circles or teams, promoting equality and collaboration. |
| **Cohort Decision Making** | Involves breaking a more extensive group into smaller cohorts to make decisions, fostering more intimate discussions and efficient decision-making. |
| **Citizen's Assemblies** | A form of deliberative democracy where a group of randomly selected citizens comes together to discuss and decide on specific issues. |
| **Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)** | A scientific approach that randomly assigns participants to different options is often used in research but can inform decision-making. |
| **Prediction Markets** | Platforms that facilitate trading contracts tied to future events harness the collective wisdom of participants to generate accurate forecasts and predictions. |
| **Smart Crowdsourcing** | Platforms like Topcoder or Kaggle connect organizations with global talent for problem-solving through competitions. |
