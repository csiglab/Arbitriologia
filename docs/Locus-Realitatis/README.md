# Locus Realitis

> The domain of material and structural reality—the interplay between the social system and its surrounding environment.

## Ontological Framework

> This **framework** is **applied recursively** to the lowest levels of social reality, as well as to more **derivative elements such as cultural, economic, political, and other domains**.
