## Research Problem

> Research in Public Economics investigates how government policies affect economic outcomes, and how policy can be designed to improve efficiency, equity, and welfare under real-world constraints.

> How should governments design and implement fiscal instruments (taxes, transfers, spending, and regulations) to correct market failures, redistribute income, and promote macroeconomic stability‚Äîwhile minimizing inefficiencies and accounting for political, informational, and behavioral constraints?
