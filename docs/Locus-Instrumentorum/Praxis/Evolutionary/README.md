# Evolutionary Economic Models

> **Evolutionary economics** is an economic theory that explores how economic systems and institutions evolve over time through the process of variation, selection, and retention of innovative practices, technologies, and organizational forms.

> **Evolutionary economics** is a branch of economics that applies concepts from evolutionary biology to understand economic phenomena, particularly the dynamics of technological change, innovation, and economic development.

> **Evolutionary economics** models often focus on the variation, selection, and adaptation processes that drive economic evolution over time.

## Evolutionary Economics

- Key idea: Economic processes evolve like biological systems with innovation and selection.

- Modeling focus: Dynamic processes, innovation diffusion, path dependence.

- Tools: Replicator dynamics, evolutionary game theory.

- Emphasis: Processes rather than static equilibria.
