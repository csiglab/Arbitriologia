    - Internal Market
    - **Management Events**
        
        → Exogenous shocks: wars, financial crises, regime changes, competitor collapses.
        
    - **Adaptive Responses**
        
        → How industries, firms, or governments reconfigure after shocks.

## A Theory of Production Networks

>  aka. Clusters.

>  Take a compnay to be a node; and take an edge; to be a relation or interaction type between firms.

> What's the tructural typology of the network?  - Which are the functions  space implemented by the firms? How is that function space map to the typology?

> Which are the functioal role in the network?

> How do we structure production?

Principles for Structuring Production Networks:

- Division of Labor: Assign firms to functions that maximize specialization and minimize redundancy.
- Connectivity Optimization: Balance network density—too sparse → fragile supply chain; too dense → coordination overhead.
- Modularity: Encourage clusters by function; modular clusters facilitate scalability, knowledge transfer, and innovation.
- Redundancy / Resilience: Ensure alternative pathways exist for critical inputs; prevents systemic failures.
- Aggregator Nodes: Lower barriers for small firms; accelerate innovation adoption and market reach.
- Knowledge Flows: Explicitly structure links for R&D spillovers, not just material supply.
