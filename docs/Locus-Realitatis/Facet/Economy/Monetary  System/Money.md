> **Thinking of money as analogous to energy** is one of the most powerful analogies. Energy is a conserved quantity in a closed system, allowing it to change forms (e.g., from kinetic to potential energy) without being lost. Similarly, money enables the transfer of value across goods, services, and assets, facilitating economic activity without losing its fundamental ability to "do work" in economic terms.

Functions:

- **Medium of exchange**: Money is used as a medium of exchange to facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers. It allows people to buy goods and services without having to trade one good for another, which makes trade more efficient and enables specialization in production.
- **Unit of account**: Money serves as a standard unit of measurement for the value of goods and services. This allows people to compare the value of different goods and services and make informed economic decisions.
- **Store of value**: Money is a store of value that allows people to save their wealth and use it in the future. It can be easily stored and retrieved when needed, unlike other forms of wealth, such as livestock or crops.
- **Standard of deferred payment**: Money can be used to make payments over time, such as through loans, credit, and debt. It serves as a standard of deferred payment that allows people to borrow and lend money over time.
