## Anthropology vs Sociology

> Anthropology and sociology are two historically differentiated strategies for producing knowledge about the same thing: the patterned, meaning-laden organization of human life.

| Aspect                       | Anthropology                                                                                                         | Sociology                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Origins**                  | Emerged in the 19th century studying *“other”* societies — small-scale, non-industrial, often colonized populations. | Emerged in the 19th century studying *modern*, industrialized societies — mainly European. |
| **Founders**                 | Boas, Malinowski, Mauss, Lévi-Strauss.                                                                               | Durkheim, Weber, Marx, Simmel.                                                             |
| **Methodological Tradition** | Ethnography, participant observation, holistic description.                                                          | Surveys, statistics, theory of institutions, class, and bureaucracy.                       |
| **Disciplinary Aim**         | Understand *culture* as a total way of life.                                                                         | Understand *society* as a structured system of relations and functions.                    |

Conceptual Convergence

- By the mid–20th century, the boundary started to erode:
- Sociologists began studying subcultures, organizations, and micro-interactions (e.g., Goffman, Garfinkel).
- Anthropologists began studying modern institutions and global systems (e.g., Appadurai, Comaroff, Latour).

Where They Still Differ (Epistemic Style)

| Dimension              | Anthropology                                  | Sociology                                                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Epistemic Attitude** | Thick description, interpretive, idiographic. | Analytical modeling, theory-driven, sometimes nomothetic. |
| **Temporal Focus**     | Long-term, historical, or evolutionary.       | Contemporary dynamics and processes.                      |
| **Language**           | Symbolic, semiotic, phenomenological.         | Structural, systemic, or causal.                          |
