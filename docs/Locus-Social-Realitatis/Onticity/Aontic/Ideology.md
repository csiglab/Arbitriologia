# Ideology

> A system of ideas, beliefs, or values that shapes the way individuals or groups perceive and interact with the world.

> An idiology can be understood as an attractor state within a cognitive or social system: a stable configuration of beliefs, practices, and values toward which the system tends to evolve and remain, despite perturbations or external influences.

Key Questions:

- What is an idiology?
- How are ideologies maintained and transmitted?
- What role do ideologies play in social conflict and change?
- How does ideology influence individual and collective behavior?
- What are the impacts of a given idiology, and what are its limits?
- Is it possible to trace the development of idiologies? Are idiologies present in all societies? Can an idiology be understood as a social-cognitive construct?

## Limits

> An idiology can simplify reality, but it risks trapping thought in rigid schemas.

> Rigid adherence can turn strategy into dogma.

## Idiology as a Primitive Cognitive Trap

> An idiology, when used as a guide for action instead of a more complex, adaptable cognitive scheme—one that incorporates reflection, vision, principles, and context—is essentially a primitive cognitive trap. It channels behavior along fixed patterns but limits understanding, adaptation, and long-term effectiveness.

## Alternative

> A **Dynamic Philosophy Theory** positions reflection and awareness as first-class capacities. These capacities enable the formulation of a long-term vision, which in turn guides the generation of a system of actionable ideas. This system continuously evolves, adapting to new insights and circumstances, ensuring that actions remain aligned with the overarching vision.
