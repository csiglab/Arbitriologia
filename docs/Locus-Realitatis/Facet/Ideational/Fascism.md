# Fascism

> Fascism is a political movement and an accompanying ideology that seeks to establish a doctrine in which the state occupies the central position in society. It systematically subordinates individual autonomy and civil institutions to its authority with the objectives of consolidating political power, enforcing social conformity, and mobilizing the population toward collective goals. Operational mechanisms include ideological propagation, mass communication and education systems, symbolic and ritual practices, and coercive instruments of social control. Fascism functions as a self-reinforcing socio-political system in which centralized authority, mobilized populations, and controlled institutions interact to maintain regime stability and enforce a coherent state-centered social order.

> Note: There is no single, monolithic “Fascism.” What exists are specific variants—“X-Fascism”—that share a common structural framework and general objectives, while differing in methods, intensity, and historical timing.

## Term

> Fasci Siciliani (1891–1894): A workers’ movement in Sicily advocating for land reform.
