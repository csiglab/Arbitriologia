### Key Technical Justifications:

1. **Meta-Strategy** – Implies a higher-order framework governing multiple subordinate strategies.
2. **Adaptive Strategic Framework** – Emphasizes flexibility and iterative adjustments.
3. **Sequential & Context-Dependent** – Recognizes phased implementation based on evolving conditions.
4. **Without Predetermination** – Rejects fixed long-term planning in favor of dynamic responsiveness.
