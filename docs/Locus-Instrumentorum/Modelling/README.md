# ðŸ§  Modeling

> To **understand society** is not to describe its surface, but to trace the hidden structures that shape human possibility. A good social model doesnâ€™t reduce complexity â€” it reveals its structure.

## ðŸ“Œ Principles

> **Perception over Reality**: Decisions made by agents in social systems are not necessarily based on objective reality, but rather on their **perceptions and interpretations** of that reality. These subjective constructions shape behavior and systemic outcomes.
