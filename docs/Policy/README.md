# Policy

> A policy is a normative instrument, often codified, that prescribes objectives, sets boundaries for acceptable actions, allocates authority, and provides mechanisms for compliance, monitoring, and revision within a political, legal, or administrative system.

> A formally authorized, purposive course of action or inaction, instituted by a public authority, intended to achieve specific social, economic, or political objectives within a defined jurisdiction, and operationalized through legal, regulatory, programmatic, or fiscal instruments.

## Policy Life Cycle

The **policy life cycle** refers to the stages through which a policy moves from its initial conception to its eventual evaluation or termination. These stages help guide the development and implementation of policies in various sectors, such as government, organizations, and corporations. Here are the common stages of the policy life cycle:

### 1. **Agenda Setting**

* **Description**: The process of identifying and prioritizing issues that need to be addressed. Policymakers, stakeholders, and the public play a role in deciding which problems are urgent enough to require action.
* **Key Activities**: Public discourse, media attention, lobbying by interest groups, and gathering data on societal needs.

### 2. **Policy Formulation**

* **Description**: This is where possible solutions to the identified problems are developed. Policymakers and experts propose different options, which may be influenced by research, public input, and political considerations.
* **Key Activities**: Policy proposals, drafting of legislation, research, consultations with stakeholders, and cost-benefit analyses.

### 3. **Policy Adoption**

* **Description**: The formal approval of a policy or proposal by the relevant governing body (e.g., parliament, board of directors). This is where decisions are made, and the policy is formally put into place.
* **Key Activities**: Voting, legislative hearings, negotiations, and passing laws or regulations.

### 4. **Policy Implementation**

* **Description**: After adoption, the policy is put into action. This includes the establishment of the necessary administrative structures, the allocation of resources, and the execution of the policyâ€™s provisions.
* **Key Activities**: Allocating funding, appointing officials or agencies to oversee implementation, creating programs, and monitoring early implementation steps.

### 5. **Policy Evaluation**

* **Description**: After the policy has been in effect for some time, its effectiveness is assessed. Evaluations can determine whether the policy achieved its intended goals, whether it had unintended consequences, and if improvements are necessary.
* **Key Activities**: Data collection, analysis, reporting findings, conducting audits, and stakeholder feedback.

### 6. **Policy Revision or Termination**

* **Description**: Based on evaluation findings, policies may be revised, adjusted, or even terminated if they are no longer relevant or effective. In some cases, the policy is replaced with a new solution.
* **Key Activities**: Amendments to laws, repeal of outdated policies, or the introduction of new policies to address evolving issues.
