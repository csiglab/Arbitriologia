. Switzerland â€“ Fiscal Federalism & Debt Brake Rule

    Key Features:

        Decentralized Taxation: Cantons (states) set their own tax rates, fostering competition (e.g., low-tax Zug attracts businesses).

        Debt Brake Rule: Constitutional limit on deficits, ensuring balanced budgets.

        VAT & Wealth Taxes: Low VAT (7.7%) but taxes on wealth and property help fund services.

    Why It Works:

        High taxpayer compliance due to transparency and local control.

        Public debt is very low (~40% of GDP).
