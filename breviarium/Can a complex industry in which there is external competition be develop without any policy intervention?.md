# Can a complex industry in which there is external competition be develop without any policy intervention?.md


### ðŸ”§ **Why Policy Intervention Is Often Necessary**

1. **Market Failures**

   * High fixed costs, long development cycles, or uncertain returns (common in tech, energy, pharma) often discourage private investment alone.
   * Example: Semiconductor industry in almost every country â€” from the U.S. CHIPS Act to Chinaâ€™s state subsidies.

2. **Infant Industry Argument**

   * New industries may need protection or nurturing until they reach competitive scale.
   * Example: South Korea's steel and automotive sectors were developed through state-backed conglomerates (chaebols) and export subsidies.

3. **External Competition Pressures**

   * Competing with already-developed foreign players is hard without:

     * Tariffs or import restrictions
     * Subsidies or tax breaks
     * Infrastructure, education, or R\&D funding

4. **Coordination Failures**

   * Many industries (e.g. aerospace) require aligned investment across multiple domains â€” capital, skills, suppliers, logistics â€” which the state can help coordinate.


### ðŸš« **What Happens Without Intervention**

* Countries without strategic support often stay stuck in low-value production or become consumers of foreign innovations.
* Unprotected or unsupported domestic firms may be outcompeted before scaling up.
* Even in laissez-faire economies, infrastructure, legal frameworks, and education systems â€” all state-managed â€” are forms of indirect intervention.


### âœ… **Rare Exceptions?**

In **niche sectors with low entry barriers** or **where private demand leads innovation** (e.g. artisanal software, fashion, certain services), development can occur without formal state support â€” but these are not usually **complex industries**.


### Summary:

**No,** complex industries competing globally almost never emerge *without* policy intervention. Even in capitalist economies, this intervention can be indirect but essential (e.g., U.S. DARPA funding led to the internet). Industrial policy, even when minimal, plays a coordinating and enabling role.

Would you like examples of successful industry development with *minimal* intervention for contrast?
