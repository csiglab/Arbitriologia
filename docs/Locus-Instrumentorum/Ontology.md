# Ontology

> An **ontology** is a formal and systematic representation of concepts, categories, and relationships within a particular domain of knowledge.

## Meta Ontological Framework

> aka. Second Order Ontology.

> Remember: The position of a researcher is that of an external observer. Be explicit about the observer’s position to properly localize reflexivity.

> A Meta-Ontological Framework is a structured system for defining, organizing, and relating the fundamental building blocks of social reality. It operates at a higher level of abstraction than domain ontologies, providing the rules, categories, and compositional logic through which social entities and processes are identified, classified, and constructed.

> This framework serves as a meta-structural foundation for modeling, simulating, and analyzing complex social systems — such as institutions, cities, power structures, roles, norms, and identities — in a rigorous and composable way.

> This enables rigorous modeling, comparison, and reasoning about social phenomena at multiple levels of abstraction.
