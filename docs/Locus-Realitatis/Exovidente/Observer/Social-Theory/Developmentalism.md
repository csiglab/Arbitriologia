# Developmentalism

> Note: Assume the position of an external observer.

> Developmentalism is an epistemological lens with ontological consequences.
It observes the world in a certain way — and by doing so, it helps create institutions that make that world real.

> An observer’s epistemological framework that generates a specific ontological configuration and dynamics.

> Developmentalism, in its most abstract form, is the belief that political actors can deliberately reshape the social and material conditions of their society through coordinated, long-term effort, typically by mobilizing state power, organizing production, and controlling resources. This schema predates capitalism, modernity, and even the nation-state.

> Developmentalism is a cognitive schema that interprets national progress as a structured, stage-based, and attainable transformation, wherein states and societies are viewed as capable of purposeful ascent through coordinated institutional effort.

> **Development** is the dialectical process through which a system (society, polity, or economy) realizes its inherent potential by navigating and resolving internal contradictions. It unfolds as a negation of negation — overcoming previous states (thesis and antithesis) to reach higher levels of complexity and self-awareness. Development is thus not linear or static, but a dynamic movement of becoming, where each stage preserves and transcends what came before, manifesting the system’s self-realization and actualization over time. - [Check This]

## Epistemological Signature

> Developmentalism is a framework of observation and interpretation — a way of seeing and making sense of national and economic progress.

> It acts like an observer or lens, shaping how we understand causality, progress, backwardness, modernity, and transformation.

> Developmentalism is also a cognitive schema — a way of perceiving and interpreting a country’s position in global hierarchies and its capacity for autonomous advancement.

> How and why this cognitive schema (Developmentalism) emerges?

| Trait                            | Description                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Teleological Orientation**     | Assumes a desirable end-state (modernity, industrialization, autonomy) that can be progressively reached.                     |
| **Comparative Positionality**    | Views nations in a developmental hierarchy — “underdeveloped,” “developing,” “developed” — with progress judged relationally. |
| **Agency-Capacity Assumption**   | Presumes that collective, especially state-led, action can alter developmental trajectories.                                  |
| **Historicist Temporality**      | Understands development as a temporal unfolding — history as a process of transformation, not stasis.                         |
| **Problem-Solution Framing**     | Underdevelopment is not natural but a deviation or failure — solvable through policy, reform, or institutional change.        |
| **Rational-Constructivist Bias** | Belief in the power of planning, policy, and institution-building to engineer progress.                                       |
| **National-Scale Cognition**     | The nation-state is the primary unit of analysis and transformation.                                                          |

## Ontological Signature

> You could treat developmentalism as a real system, made up of institutions, state forms, bureaucratic capabilities, ideologies, and class coalitions — i.e., a historically instantiated configuration.

> This moves beyond ideas and into what developmentalism does in the world — how it organizes production, coordinates actors, disciplines capital, structures the state, etc.

> So it's not just a lens, but a material-social arrangement or an institutional complex.

## QA

### What explains the emergence of a developmentalist (techno-productivist) cognitive schema among political and social actors in some societies, while it fails to take root in others?

> Note: When we refer to schema adoption, we are not speaking of society as a whole, but rather of a critical mass of relatively influential observers within the system.

> Developmentalism emerges wherever **elites imagine that reality can be can reshape** itself through strategic coordination, resource control, and future orientation.

> The **developmentalist schema doesn't arise spontaneously — it emerges when certain material, symbolic, and experiential thresholds are crossed. These thresholds activate a new kind of political imagination that sees transformation as both possible and necessary.

> The developmentalist cognitive state arises when relative decline, external pressure, or internal crisis combine with elite exposure to alternative models, the capacity to imagine systems, and a belief that the future is malleable. It’s a response to disruption, but one that depends on institutional imagination and symbolic reframing of what the polity is and can become.

| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Relative Backwardness**          | The perception of being behind others (militarily, technologically, economically) provokes a desire to catch up. |
| **External Threat / Pressure**     | War, colonization, or humiliation forces rethinking of internal capacity and strategic self-reliance.            |
| **Exposure to Advanced Systems**   | Elites observe or are educated in more developed societies and import blueprints or comparisons.                 |
| **Demographic or Economic Crisis** | A breakdown in reproduction or governance forces elites to seek alternative systems to maintain order.           |

| **Historical Learning**                | Seeing how other societies transformed (e.g., Meiji Japan observing the West; Prussia observing England).            |
| **Systems Thinking**                   | Ability to perceive society as a system with manipulable components (tax, labor, land, education).                   |

| **Time as Open/Future-Oriented**  | The future is imagined as an open field for intervention — not fated, cyclical, or preordained.              |
| **The State as Steward**          | A shift occurs in how the state is seen — not as extractor, but as **engineer** or **guardian** of progress. |
