| **Classical Antiquity (Aristotle)**                                       | Usefulness in use (*value in use*) vs. exchangeability (*value in exchange*) | Foundational distinction; no unified quantitative theory of value.                                   |
| **Scholastic Economics (Medieval period)**                                | Just price reflecting social and moral order                                 | Value linked to ethical norms, fairness, and community equilibrium rather than markets alone.        |
| **Early Mercantilism (16th–17th c.)**                                     | Monetary worth realized in trade                                             | Value largely identified with price and money received in exchange.                                  |

| **Classical Political Economy (Smith, Ricardo; late 18th–early 19th c.)** | Labor embodied or commanded                                                  | Duality between labor-embodied and labor-commanded measures; groundwork for labor theories of value. |
| **Marxian Economics (mid-19th c.)**                                       | Socially necessary abstract labor time                                       | Value as a social relation specific to capitalism; distinct from price and utility.                  |

| **Neoclassical Economics (20th c.)**                                      | Equilibrium price reflecting marginal utilities and scarcities               | Value operationalized as price under competitive equilibrium assumptions.                            |
| **Institutional Economics (early–mid 20th c.)**                           | Socially constructed worth shaped by institutions                            | Value influenced by norms, habits, and legal–organizational structures.                              |
| **Keynesian & Post-Keynesian Thought**                                    | Monetary value formed under uncertainty                                      | Emphasis on expectations, money, and non-ergodicity in valuation.                                    |
| **Contemporary Economics**                                                | Context-dependent valuation (market, financial, informational)               | Multiple coexisting notions: market value, option value, data value, platform value.                 |

## Formulation

> What is the ontological **nature** of **value**?

> Value is a second-order, socially constituted, temporally realized relational **magnitude** that emerges endogenously from the coordinated interaction of agents, production processes, and institutions, and is operationally instantiated through symbolic media (money, prices, accounts) which stabilize, communicate, and reproduce that magnitude within an economic system.
