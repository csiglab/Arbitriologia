| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Institutions Shape Economic Outcomes**    | Economic performance is deeply influenced by political institutions and power structures.                       | Institutional design is key to development and policy effectiveness.                           |
| **Political Constraints on Redistribution** | Governments often fail to implement optimal redistributive policies due to elite capture or political pressure. | Explains inequality persistence despite democratic systems.                                    |
| **Credible Commitment Problem**             | Political actors may not stick to promised policies due to short-term incentives.                               | Institutions must be designed to enforce long-term credible commitments (e.g., central banks). |
| **Selectorate Theory**                      | Political leaders allocate resources to maintain power, not necessarily to benefit society.                     | Predicts behavior under different regime types (e.g., democracies vs autocracies).             |
| **Resource Curse**                          | Countries with abundant natural resources may suffer from poor institutions and governance.                     | Resource wealth can hinder development if political institutions are weak.                     |
| **Political Business Cycles**               | Politicians manipulate fiscal/monetary policy to boost the economy before elections.                            | Explains timing of economic interventions and market instability.                              |
| **Endogenous Policy Formation**             | Policies are the outcome of bargaining among interest groups, not just economic optimization.                   | Highlights the role of lobbying and political pressure in shaping policy.                      |
| **State Capacity and Development**          | Strong bureaucracies and legal enforcement mechanisms are crucial for sustained economic development.           | State-building is central to long-term growth.                                                 |
