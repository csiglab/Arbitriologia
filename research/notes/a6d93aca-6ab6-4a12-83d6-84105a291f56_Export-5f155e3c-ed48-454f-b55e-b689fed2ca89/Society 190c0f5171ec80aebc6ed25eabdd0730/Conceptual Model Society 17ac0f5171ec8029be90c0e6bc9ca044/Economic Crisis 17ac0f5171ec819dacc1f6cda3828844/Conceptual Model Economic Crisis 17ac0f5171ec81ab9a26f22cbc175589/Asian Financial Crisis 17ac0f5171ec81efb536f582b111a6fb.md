# Asian Financial Crisis

> Have to **check this propositions**.

A combination of several interrelated factors caused the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997-1998:

1. **Excessive Short-term Borrowing**: Many Asian countries accumulated large amounts of short-term foreign debt that they could not repay when confidence in their economies waned.
2. **Fixed Exchange Rates**: Several countries, including Thailand, maintained fixed exchange rates pegged to the US dollar, which overvalued their currencies and led to unsustainable trade deficits.
3. **Speculative Attacks**: As doubts about the sustainability of these fixed exchange rates grew, speculative attacks on the currencies led to devaluations, further exacerbating the crisis.
4. **Weak Financial Systems**: The financial systems in many affected countries needed to be stronger and better regulated. Banks engaged in risky lending practices and needed more capital buffers.
5. **Overinvestment and Asset Bubbles**: Excessive investment in real estate and other sectors led to asset bubbles that eventually burst when the crisis hit.
6. **Declining Export Competitiveness**: With pegged currencies and rising labor costs, these economies' export competitiveness declined, leading to lower export revenues.
7. **Loss of Investor Confidence**: Rapid outflows of foreign capital occurred as international investors lost confidence in the region's economic stability.
8. **Contagion Effect**: The crisis spread quickly from one country to another due to interconnected financial markets and investor panic, leading to a regional crisis.

These factors combined created a severe financial crisis that resulted in significant economic downturns in many Asian countries.
