## Self Organization

> While self-organization has its strengths, it faces significant challenges when it comes to complexity and coordination. Introducing coordination brokers can mitigate these challenges by reducing complexity, improving scalability, and enabling the creation of more complex structures. This approach leverages the benefits of self-organization while addressing its limitations, making it a powerful strategy for building robust and scalable systems.
