# Certification

> Certification is an official process or document that confirms someone or something has met specific standards or qualifications set by a recognized authority.

Certification solves several problems, including:

1. **Trust and Credibility** – It provides assurance that individuals, products, or organizations meet established standards.
2. **Quality Assurance** – It helps ensure consistent quality and performance.
3. **Risk Reduction** – It lowers the risk of failure, non-compliance, or incompetence.
4. **Market Access** – It enables entry into regulated or competitive markets that require proof of qualification or compliance.
5. **Accountability** – It sets clear benchmarks for responsibility and evaluation.
6. **Transparency** – It standardizes expectations, making evaluations more objective and comparable.
