- Data Analysis of Diversification Path:  Years / Country.
- Specific In Death Case Studies / Industry Case Study
- Which causes **structural transformation**?
- What are the production cost for a product **P** in place **Y**?
- Can a complex productive ecosystem emerge spontaneously?
    - How economical structural transformation happens?
    - How to capture a **economical productive configuration**?
        - R&D Agent → Add a More Deep Structure
        - Financial Agent → Add a More Deep Structure
        - Firms Agent → Add Links to Form Value Chains; Add the  [Sector]; Put all the firms together
            - Sectorial Organization → Division of Labor
            - Network Structure → Matrix → Products (Underlying Technology)
        - Labor Market Structure → Add a deep structure (Model this a a Pool)
        - **Regulatory Agents:**
            - Apply regulation usually **negative feedback**.
            - Tributary Structure
    - **With X as a Regulatory Structure**; which effects does it have in the **dynamics**; of the **network**?
    - How to model `Infraestructure`  in the economic network?
        - Capacity to move things
        - Capacity to move data
        - Infra-estructure as capacity ….
    - How to model the government in this setting?  The government should be though as outside agent; trying to **`change`** the network.
    - What is the **probability** that a **economic structure configuration** is reach?
    - What is the **“critical mass“** of 'things' needed to achieve an **equilibrium-breaking** transition from one **economic structural configuration** to another?
    - An **economic structural configuration** is reached through **equilibrium-breaking steps**.
- Which are the limits of **self organization**?
- Why are the limitation of **auto structural transformation**?
- Which are the consecuences of `policy agents` not working directly **towards structural transformation**?
- Cluster Competitivity Evaluation → …
- Cost Structure …
- Can I Productive Ecosystem X emerge without any economic state-craft?

## **Economical Productive Configuration**

```python
# Re-import necessary libraries after execution environment reset
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Initialize directed graph
G = nx.DiGraph()

# Define main nodes and their attributes
core_node = "Economic Productive Configuration"
main_nodes = ["R&D Agent", "Financial Agent", "Firms Agent", "Labor Market Structure"]

# Add the core node
G.add_node(core_node)

# Add main nodes and connections to the core node
for node in main_nodes:
    G.add_node(node)
    G.add_edge(core_node, node)

# Define additional nodes and connections for each main agent
sub_nodes = {
    "R&D Agent": ["Deep Structure (Innovation Layers)", "Link to Financial Agent", "Link to Firms Agent"],
    "Financial Agent": ["Deep Structure (Capital Sources)", "Link to R&D Agent", "Link to Firms Agent", "Link to Labor Market Structure"],
    "Firms Agent": ["Sectorial Links (Agriculture, Technology)", "Value Chains", "Link to Labor Market Structure", "Link to Financial Agent"],
    "Labor Market Structure": ["Deep Structure (Labor Pool)", "Link to Firms Agent"]
}

# Add sub-nodes and edges
for main_node, sub_node_list in sub_nodes.items():
    for sub_node in sub_node_list:
        G.add_node(sub_node)
        G.add_edge(main_node, sub_node)

# Add additional inter-agent links
G.add_edge("R&D Agent", "Firms Agent")
G.add_edge("Financial Agent", "Firms Agent")
G.add_edge("Financial Agent", "R&D Agent")
G.add_edge("Firms Agent", "Sectorial Links (Agriculture, Technology)")
G.add_edge("Firms Agent", "Labor Market Structure")
G.add_edge("Financial Agent", "Labor Market Structure")

# Plotting the network graph
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)
nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_size=3000, node_color="skyblue", font_size=8, font_weight="bold", edge_color="gray", arrowsize=10)
plt.title("Economic Productive Configuration Network Graph")
plt.show()
