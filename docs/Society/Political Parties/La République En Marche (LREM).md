**La République En Marche! (LREM)** — now officially renamed **Renaissance** (since 2022) — is a **centrist, pro-European political party in France**, founded by **Emmanuel Macron** in 2016. It is one of the most modern and structurally distinctive parties in Europe.

## 🧬 Key Features of LREM (Renaissance)

### 🏗️ **1. Startup-Inspired Structure**

* Created rapidly (in \~12 months) before Macron’s 2017 presidential victory.
* Organized like a **startup**:

  * Agile
  * Tech-driven
  * Non-hierarchical in early stages
  * Emphasis on innovation, disruption, and pragmatism over ideology

### 📲 **2. Digital-First Strategy**

* Early use of **data analytics, online platforms, and crowdsourcing**:

  * Macron’s team surveyed **over 25,000 citizens** to shape their platform
  * Campaign focused on digital engagement instead of traditional rallies
* Volunteer “marcheurs” walked door to door collecting feedback (hence *En Marche!*)

### 🧠 **3. Technocratic Policy Labs**

* Developed policies through:

  * Expert-driven task forces
  * Partnerships with academics, civil society, and entrepreneurs
  * High reliance on **evidence-based policymaking** and sectoral diagnostics

### 🎓 **4. Professional Candidate Selection**

* In 2017, LREM fielded candidates in **all 577 constituencies** for the National Assembly, **many without prior political experience**.
* Emphasis on:

  * Diversity (gender, background)
  * Professional achievement
  * Alignment with movement’s values and civic professionalism
* Required **integrity vetting and compatibility assessments**

### ⚙️ **5. Internal Organization**

After 2017, LREM built formal structures:

| Component                         | Function                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Executive Bureau**              | Core leadership, decision-making                                 |
| **Political Council**             | Broader advisory body including ministers, MPs, regional leaders |
| **Local Committees**              | Grassroots activity, still largely volunteer-based               |
| **Campus En Marche!**             | Political training and candidate development                     |
| **Think Tank: “Ideas En Marche”** | Coordinates policy debates and platform updates                  |

## 🌐 Ideology and Position

| Dimension        | Orientation                                                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Economic         | Pro-business, liberalized labor market, pro-innovation           |
| Social           | Progressive but cautious; supports meritocracy and modernization |
| EU Position      | Strongly pro-European and integrationist                         |
| Traditional Axis | Seeks to transcend the left–right divide                         |

It’s often called a **“post-ideological”** or **technocratic centrist party**, though this has drawn both praise and criticism.

## 🏛️ Evolution and Current Status

* **Rebranded as Renaissance** in 2022 to reflect its role in building a broader coalition (*Ensemble!*) for Macron’s second term.
* Part of a **European alliance** of liberal and pro-European parties (ALDE/Renew Europe).
* Faces structural challenges now: **less grassroots coherence** than traditional parties, **harder to maintain unity** post-Macron.
