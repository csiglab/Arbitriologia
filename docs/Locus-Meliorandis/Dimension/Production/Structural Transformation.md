## Superficial Industrialiation

Building Indigenous Technological and Innovative Capabilities is Not a Major Economic Policy Objective → Superficial Industrialization.

- Unlike Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, S&T elements were not part of the broader
economic policies, namely, industrial policy, investment policy, trade policy, and, to a lesser extent, education policies (see Intarakumnerd et. al., 2002).
- You Can See The Problem: The Minister of Economic Affairs needs more participation in the R&D Policy.
- Except for the automobile industry, there were no reciprocal performance-based criteria (such as **export** and **local value added** and **technological upgrading targets**) for providing state incentives like in Korea and Taiwan (Amsden 1989, 2001; Amsden and Chu, 2003). Investment promotion privileges, for example, were provided upon approval to set up businesses.
