## List of Theories of Firms

> **Theories of the business firm** explore various aspects of why firms exist, how they operate, and what their motivations are.
> 

> Here's a table summarizing some of the key theories in the study of business firms:
> 

| Theory | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Neoclassical Theory** | Focuses on profit maximization as firms' primary objective, assuming perfect market competition. |
| **Behavioral Theory** | Proposes that firms seek satisfaction rather than maximum profits due to bounded rationality and uncertainties. |
| **Managerial Theory** | Suggests that managers prioritize sales maximization, personal utility, and other objectives over profit maximization due to the separation of ownership and control. |
| **Agency Theory** | Examines issues that arise from conflicts of interest between principals (owners) and agents (managers), emphasizing the costs of resolving such disputes. |
| **Transaction Cost Theory** | Introduced by Oliver Williamson, it argues that firms exist because they can perform transactions more efficiently than the market when transaction costs are high. |
| **Resource-Based View (RBV)** | Focuses on the firm's internal capabilities and resources to achieve competitive advantage and sustained performance. |
| **Evolutionary Theory** | It examines firms from a dynamic perspective, focusing on innovation processes and the evolution of firm capabilities over time. |
| **Stakeholder Theory** | Suggests that firms are influenced by the needs and demands of various stakeholders, not just shareholders, in achieving their objectives. |
| **Institutional Theory** | This paper examines institutions' influence— formal (laws, regulations) and informal (norms, cultures)—on firm behavior. |
| **Theory of the Firm as a Nexus of Contracts** | Describes the firm as a collection of contracts among self-interested individuals, including employees, suppliers, and customers. |

# Firm Innovation

> **Innovation and R&D:** Assesses the company’s commitment to research and development and innovation in its industry.
> 

> "Models of Firm Innovation" refers to **theoretical frameworks** or **conceptual models** that elucidate the processes, strategies, and factors influencing innovation within businesses or organizations.
> 

## Firms Are Primary  Actors  In the R&D System

- Firms compete internationally, but thanks to the **linear innovation model**, **T**hai policy tried to enhance only one part of the R&D Networks PRIs. It did not attack the problems of innovation ‘within firms’ and knowledge flow between firms and other actors in the **Production** Ecosystem.
