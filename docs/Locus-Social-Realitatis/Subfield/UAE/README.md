# 🇦🇪 United Arab Emirates (UAE)

> The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a federation of seven emirates on the southeastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula, strategically positioned at the crossroads of Asia, Europe, and Africa. Since its founding in 1971, the UAE has transformed from a primarily subsistence-based economy into a globally connected, diversified economy driven by hydrocarbons, finance, trade, tourism, and advanced technology. The country combines ambitious state-led development strategies with a vision-driven approach to innovation, sustainability, and human capital development, positioning itself as a regional hub for business, science, and technology.
