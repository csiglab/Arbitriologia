| **1800–1890 (“Long 19th Century”)**                | - Spain remained largely agrarian; slow demographic growth and limited industrialization. ([Wiki Historia][1])  <br>- **Desamortización**: Liberal governments confiscated and sold Church and municipal lands, reshaping land ownership but not creating broad-based agricultural productivity gains. ([Wiki Historia][1])  <br>- Railroads begin development; transport infrastructure slowly modernizes. ([Oposinet][2])  <br>- Banking modernization: consolidation and crisis, establishment of Banco de España, financial institutions evolving. ([Wiki Historia][3])  <br>- Industrial “dual” economy: industrialization concentrated in Catalonia (textiles) and Basque region; elsewhere, weak industrial base. ([Apuntes][4]) |
| **1890–1936 (First Globalization & Interwar)**     | - Spain participates in the first wave of globalization; export‑import patterns change. ([UAB Digital Document Repository][5]) <br>- Structural change in 1920s: some industrial growth, but still weak relative to other European powers. ([UAB Digital Document Repository][5]) <br>- Agrarian crisis & reform: efforts at agrarian reform during the Second Republic (e.g., 1932), but limited success. ([UAB Digital Document Repository][5]) <br>- Financial instability, political instability, the Great Depression’s effects. <br>- Civil War (1936–1939) disrupts everything.                                                                                                                                                  |
| **1939–1959 (Franco, Autarky)**                    | - After the Civil War, Spain pursues autarkic economic policies: self-sufficiency, import‑substitution. ([Wikipedia][6]) <br>- Creation of **Instituto Nacional de Industria (INI)** (1941) to lead state‐led industrialization. ([Wikipedia][7]) <br>- Heavy state intervention, nationalized firms in steel, energy, transport, automotive. ([Company Histories][8]) <br>- Slow recovery, but groundwork for later growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **1959–1974 (“Spanish Miracle”)**                  | - Plan de Estabilización (1959): liberalization, stabilizing economy. ([Wikipedia][6]) <br>- High GDP growth (~6.5% annually) — the so-called “Spanish economic miracle.” ([Wikipedia][9]) <br>- Rapid industrialization: expansion in steel (Basque), shipbuilding, automotive (e.g., SEAT), petrochemicals. ([Wikipedia][9]) <br>- Tourism begins to take off, services grow. <br>- Migration: rural → urban; internal migration fuels labor supply for industry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **1975–1985 (Crisis and Transition)**              | - Oil shocks hit Spain; industrial crisis; unemployment rises. ([UAB Digital Document Repository][5]) <br>- Political transition after Franco: new institutions, social pacts (e.g., Pactos de la Moncloa 1977) to stabilize macroeconomy. ([UAB Digital Document Repository][5]) <br>- Fiscal and banking reforms; welfare state expansion; preparing for Europe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **1986–1998 (EU Integration)**                     | - Spain joins the European Economic Community (1986). ([UAB Digital Document Repository][5]) <br>- Structural reforms, liberalization, privatizations, renewed foreign investment. <br>- Sectoral shift: services (especially tourism) become major, industrial modernization. <br>- Use of EU structural funds for infrastructure and R&D.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **1999–Present (Globalization, Crisis, Recovery)** | - Continued integration in global economy; increased FDI; more competitive industries (auto, renewable energy, ICT). <br>- 2008 financial crisis had heavy impact (real‑estate, construction). <br>- Recent pivot: industrial policy + “green” transformation, digitalization, EU Recovery Funds (e.g., NextGenerationEU). <br>- R&D and innovation growing, but productivity remains a structural challenge. <br>- High dependence on tourism; structural inequality; housing challenges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Human Capacity Profile

> España fue una potencia literaria, jurídica y filosófica en un país semiindustrial y científicamente subdesarrollado.
>

| Área | Situación |
| --- | --- |
| **Literatura** | Muy fuerte: siglo de escritores como Benito Pérez Galdós, Emilia Pardo Bazán, Unamuno, Valle-Inclán, Lorca. España era una potencia literaria mundial. |
| **Filosofía** | Notable: generación del 98 (Unamuno, Ortega y Gasset), pensamiento sobre decadencia nacional, europeización, modernidad. |
| **Derecho** | Avanzado: códigos civiles y penales modernos, fuerte tradición de juristas. Derecho español tenía prestigio en Hispanoamérica. |
| **Ciencia y Técnica** | Mucho más débil: pocos físicos, ingenieros o inventores mundialmente destacados. Pequeños núcleos científicos (Cajal, etc.), pero poco peso global. |
| **Industria** | Subdesarrollada: focos industriales pequeños (textil en Cataluña, minería en Asturias y Vizcaya, construcción naval en Cádiz y Cartagena), pero insuficientes para industrializar el país entero. |
