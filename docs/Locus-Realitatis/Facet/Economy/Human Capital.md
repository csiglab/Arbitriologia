## Social Capital

> Social Capital is a form of energy that gives rise to a society.

**Social Capital** refers to the value derived from individuals' social networks and connections. It encompasses the relationships, trust, and social norms between people and within communities.

**Social Capital** is a resource that individuals and communities can draw upon to achieve their goals, whether they are personal, social, or economic. It can manifest in different forms, such as social support, information sharing, and collaboration, and can be built through social activities such as volunteering, community involvement, and networking.

Some benefits of **social capital** include access to information and resources, increased social support, improved health outcomes, and more significant economic opportunities. On the other hand, a lack of social capital can result in social isolation, limited options, and increased vulnerability.

> Instead of **socializing capital**, it's about **capitalizing on the social**. Therefore, it's necessary to coordinate education and work, foster a new entrepreneurial culture, and drive science and technology forward.
