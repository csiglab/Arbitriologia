# Terminology: Industry - Service

## Index

## What is the industrial sector?

> Involves the production of physical goods through manufacturing, construction, mining, and related activities.
> 

> **Economic Role**: Transforms raw materials into finished goods.
> 

## Service Sector

> Involves activities that provide intangible value—such as expertise, convenience, or support—rather than physical products.
> 

> **Economic Role**: Facilitates other sectors and supports consumption and quality of life.
> 

## **Why Software Engineering Is Closer to Industry**

> But It Also Enables Services.
> 
- **Creates a Product (Good)**: Software is a digital product—once developed, it can be copied and distributed at scale, just like manufactured goods.
- **Build Phase Is Industrial**: The engineering process—design, coding, testing—is akin to product manufacturing.
- **Capital-Intensive Development**: It requires skilled labor, tooling (IDEs, CI/CD pipelines), and often significant R&D, similar to industrial product development.
- **Product Lifecycle**: Software goes through design, production, maintenance, and end-of-life stages—mirroring industrial goods.

## On the Relevance of Manufacturing

### **Manufacturing and Technology as the Basis of Prosperity**

Even if modern manufacturing is highly automated and employs fewer people, it still:

- **Drives productivity growth**: Producing more with less is central to long-term economic expansion.
- **Enables upstream and downstream industries**: Think of chips enabling smartphones, which then support entire service ecosystems (apps, logistics, digital marketing).
- **Fuels innovation**: The industrial sector is responsible for a large share of R&D spending, especially in areas like semiconductors, robotics, and advanced materials.

### **Services Can't Exist Without Physical Foundations**

Services (like finance, entertainment, healthcare) rely heavily on manufactured goods:

- A streaming service needs servers, fiber optics, and chips.
- Hospitals need MRI machines, drugs, and diagnostic devices.
- Finance runs on data centers and secure hardware.

### **Employment ≠ Value Creation**

Many believe that because manufacturing doesn't employ as many people anymore, it’s less important. But:

- **Jobs have shifted**, not disappeared. Tech boosts productivity, freeing labor to move into higher-order services.
- Value creation **still depends on the physical world**—from energy systems to infrastructure.

### **Service Economies Without Manufacturing Lose Leverage**

Countries that offload all manufacturing become **strategically dependent** on those who retain industrial capacity:

- Loss of **supply chain control**
- Vulnerability in **national security**
- Lag in **technological competitiveness**

## Is There any Technological Innovation in the Service Sector?

> The adjective Tech Adoption is often more useful.
> 

> Not fundamentally; primarily, process innovations involving technical tools are used to improve workflows.
> 

> Most "innovations" credited to the *service sector* (like telemedicine) are actually **technical artifacts** developed in the **industrial/tech sector**, then **applied** in services like healthcare.
> 

> **Objection**: There *are* fundamental technological innovations in areas like automation, artificial intelligence, data analytics, and cloud computing that are also shaping the sector.
> 
> 
> **Response**: It's more a matter of categorization. These technologies are not directly part of the service sector; they originate from product R&D, algorithms, and software systems—essentially, digital goods. While these innovations are applied in service settings, they are primarily the result of technical R&D that transforms *bits* rather than *atoms*. They reshape workflows and service delivery, but they don't fundamentally change the core nature of services themselves. The transformation is more about optimizing processes and enhancing efficiency through digital tools, rather than creating tangible, physical products.
> 

> **Tech innovation** = "We invented something new."
> 

> **Service innovation** = "We used existing things in a new way to create value."; aka  Technological Adoption.
> 

How to **classify** this?

> These cases are tech adoption, yes; but they have reconfigured the sector.
> 
- True service **reconfiguration** (e.g., Uber’s ride-hailing model didn’t just adopt GPS—it redesigned transportation as a platform service).
- Novel **business models** (e.g., subscription-based healthcare, where the tech is secondary to the pricing/service structure).
- **Experience-driven** innovation (e.g., Disney’s MagicBand—RFID tech existed, but the seamless park experience was a service breakthrough).

Conclusion:

- The term 'service innovation' is often ambiguous. While it is frequently enabled by technological advancements, it primarily involves the adoption and adaptation of existing technologies—not necessarily their invention. In some cases, this adoption leads to a fundamental reconfiguration of workflows, business models, or even entire industries (e.g., Uber, Netflix). However, not all service innovation is transformative; much of it is incremental efficiency gains through digitization.
