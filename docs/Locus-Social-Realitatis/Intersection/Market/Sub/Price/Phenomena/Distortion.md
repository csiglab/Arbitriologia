# Price Distortion

> Price distortion = messing up the cost structure as represented by prices.

Guiding Questions:

- How should we conceptualize the phenomenon of price distortion?
- What is the underlying ontic reality involved?
- What is the underlying synontic reality involved?

- What does it mean, precisely, for a price to be “distorted”?
- Distorted relative to what reference structure?
- Is distortion a binary condition or a continuous deviation?
- Can price distortion exist locally without implying systemic failure?
- Under what conditions does distortion become structurally persistent rather than transient?

- What real processes generate costs, scarcity, and production constraints?
- What physical, energetic, technological, and temporal limits shape opportunity cost?
- How do capital depreciation, learning curves, and irreversibility affect real cost structures?
- How does time (lags, investment horizons, gestation periods) alter the ontic cost landscape?
- Which constraints are hard (physics, biology, thermodynamics) versus soft (organizational capacity)?
- How do R&D investments create non-linear cost structures invisible to short-term pricing?
- What real resource misallocations emerge when prices diverge from opportunity cost?
- How do path-dependencies in infrastructure or technology constrain feasible prices?

- Which coordination mechanisms participate in price formation?
- Which actors possess asymmetric power to influence price signals?
- How do institutional rules redefine who bears opportunity costs?
- When does price become a political artifact rather than a coordination signal?
- How do financial instruments decouple prices from productive constraints?
- How do expectations, conventions, and trust stabilize distorted prices?
- How do credit guarantees or bailouts alter risk pricing structurally?
- When does distortion function as coordination scaffolding rather than failure?
- How do elite cognitive schemas normalize persistent distortions?
- Can multiple incompatible price regimes coexist within the same economy?

- What do agents believe prices represent?
- Do actors interpret prices as:
  - scarcity indicators?
  - policy outcomes?
  - political commitments?
  - signals of future intervention?
- Which models of price formation dominate elite decision-making?
- How do accounting conventions misrepresent real opportunity costs?
- How does uncertainty or model incompleteness distort interpretation even if prices are “correct”?
- When do prices cease to function as informational signals and become symbolic markers?
- How does time-scale mismatch (short-term prices vs long-term investments) generate epistemic distortion?
- Which distortions are visible only at system level, not agent level?


- How do short-term distortions propagate into long-term structural misallocation?
- Can long-term investments justify temporary price distortion?
- When does distortion accelerate capability formation?
- When does it suppress adaptive learning?
- How does repeated intervention reshape future price expectations?
- Do distorted prices reconfigure the investment landscape permanently?
- Under what conditions does distortion become endogenous and self-reinforcing?


- Distortion for whom?
- Distortion relative to which opportunity cost?
- Distortion at which time scale?
- Distortion within which coordination regime?
- Is the distortion correcting a deeper failure or masking it?
- Does removing the distortion improve or degrade systemic performance?


- Is “price distortion” an analytical concept or a normative judgment?
- Can distortion only be defined inside a specific theory of coordination?
- Does the concept presuppose an idealized market benchmark?
- What happens if no single “correct price” exists?
- Are some distortions constitutive of development itself?
