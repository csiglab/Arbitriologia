# Legal Theory

> How can we ground the law?

QA:

- What is the name for the laws -  that codigy `special powers` almost unconstraint - to special agents in the 'State Framework' of Social Organization?

## Special Power

> aka. State of Exception - Emergency Powers.

> This is a “white card”—a type of legal paraguas that you can invoke to act with broad authority. When invoked, it creates a temporary normative sphere in which normal rules are suspended and almost anything is permissible. Once the task is completed, the paraguas is withdrawn, and normal legal order is restored.

> Another useful form of this is the postponement of the application of the law—that is, you can act freely in the present, and only later will the law be applied or enforced.
