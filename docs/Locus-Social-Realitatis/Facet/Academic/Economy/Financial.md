# Financial Economics

> **Financial Economics** is a specialized branch of economics that studies how individuals, institutions, and markets allocate and manage resources over time under conditions of risk and uncertainty, with a focus on the behavior, valuation, and dynamics of financial assets and financial markets.

## Domain

- **Asset Pricing**: Understanding how securities (stocks, bonds, derivatives) are priced based on risk, return, and information.

- **Portfolio Theory**: Analyzing how investors optimize portfolios to balance expected return against risk.

- **Market Efficiency**: Investigating whether and how market prices reflect all available information (Efficient Market Hypothesis).

- **Risk Management**: Studying methods to measure, hedge, and insure against financial risks.

- **Corporate Finance**: Examining how firms raise capital, allocate funds, and manage financial decisions.

- **Behavioral Finance**: Exploring how psychological factors and cognitive biases influence financial decisions and market outcomes.

- **Derivatives and Arbitrage**: Pricing and trading of financial instruments whose value derives from underlying assets.

## Research Problem

> A Finance Economic Research Problem refers to a specific question or challenge within financial economics that researchers aim to investigate, analyze, or solve. These problems often revolve around understanding market behaviors, asset pricing, risk, and the impact of economic policies on financial systems under uncertainty.

## Key Results

| **Result**                             | **Description**                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)**  | Financial markets efficiently incorporate all available information into asset prices.                                    |
| **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)** | Asset expected returns are linearly related to their systematic risk (beta).                                              |
| **Fama-French Factors**                | Market risk alone does not explain returns; size and value factors improve asset pricing models.                          |
| **Market Anomalies**                   | Empirical deviations from classical models, such as momentum, January effect, and volatility clustering.                  |
| **Risk-Return Tradeoff**               | Higher risk investments tend to offer higher expected returns, but not always linearly.                                   |
| **Diversification Reduces Risk**       | Holding a diversified portfolio lowers unsystematic risk without sacrificing expected return.                             |
| **Option Pricing Models**              | Formulas like Black-Scholes provide theoretical values for derivatives based on assumptions about volatility and markets. |
| **Behavioral Biases Affect Markets**   | Psychological factors lead to mispricings and deviations from rational expectations.                                      |
| **Liquidity Impacts Asset Prices**     | Illiquid assets typically have higher expected returns due to trading costs and risks.                                    |
| **Systemic Risk Transmission**         | Financial crises spread through interconnected institutions and markets, amplifying shocks.                               |
| **Informational Asymmetry**            | Unequal information among market participants leads to adverse selection and moral hazard problems.                       |
