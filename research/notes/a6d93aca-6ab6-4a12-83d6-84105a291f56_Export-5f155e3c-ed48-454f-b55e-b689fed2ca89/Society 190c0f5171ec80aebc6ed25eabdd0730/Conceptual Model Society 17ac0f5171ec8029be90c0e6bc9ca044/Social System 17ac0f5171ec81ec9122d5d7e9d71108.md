# Social System

: 13

> **Social Science:** The study of emergent behavior in groups of individuals, exploring how collective actions and interactions lead to complex phenomena. It is closely related to psychology and neuroscience, examining how social dynamics influence and are influenced by cognitive and neurological processes.
> 

> A **society** can be defined as a set of agents (individuals, firms, …) who share a common set of resources (territory, infra-estructure, institutions, …), interact with one another, and are connected by social relationships and institutions.
> 

> ¿What drives a new society typHuman resources (HR) e? Size and  Technology (Food, Health, Transportation, Computation, Communication, Transportation)

> "Insanity in individuals is rare, but in groups, parties, nations, it is the rule." - Nietzsche
> 

> Social dynamics: Complexity Science applied to social systems. It studies how social systems change over time.

## Social System

> **Characterizing a social system** involves understanding its various components and dynamics.
> 

> A **social system is a complex network** of interconnected individuals, groups, institutions, and norms that shape and govern social interactions within a society.

| **Feature** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Social Structure** | Arrangement of societal roles, statuses, and relationships, including hierarchies and divisions of labor. |
| **Institutions** | Formalized structures and mechanisms like government, education, religion, family, and economy. |
| **Norms** | Shared expectations and rules that guide behavior and interactions within society. |
| **Values** | Collective beliefs about what is essential and desirable influence behavior. |
| **Roles** | Positions individuals occupy within the social structure and the expected behaviors associated with them. |
| **Groups and Networks** | Social groups, organizations, and networks contribute to social identity and interactions. |
| **Socialization** | The process by which individuals learn and internalize society's values, norms, and behaviors. |
| **Power Dynamics** | Distribution and exercise of power and authority within society, including political, economic, and social control. |
| **Culture** | Shared symbols, language, rituals, customs, and artifacts give a society its identity. |
| **Social Change** | Processes of societal evolution and transformation, including technological and cultural shifts. |
| **Social Institutions** | Formal structures govern specific areas of social life, like education, family, and government. |
| **Social Stratification** | Society is divided into hierarchical layers based on income, wealth, education, and social status. |
| **Social Mobility** | The ability of individuals or groups to move within the social stratification system is influenced by education and opportunities. |
| **Social Control** | Mechanisms and strategies societies use to regulate behavior and maintain order, including laws and norms. |
| **Conflict and Cooperation** | The interplay between competition and societal cooperation is often related to resources and power. |
| **Social Identity** | How individuals and groups define themselves in relation to others, shaped by ethnicity, gender, religion, etc. |
| **Social Capital** | Networks of relationships and connections that contribute to social cohesion and opportunities. |
| **Globalization** | Increasing interconnectedness of societies through technology, trade, and cultural exchange. |
| **Demographics** | Population characteristics, such as age, gender, ethnicity, and growth, influence the social system. |
| **Social Movements** | Collective efforts to bring about social or political change, often in response to perceived injustices. |
| **Economic Systems** | One way to categorize societies is based on their economic systems. This includes distinguishing between capitalist societies, where the means of production are privately owned, and socialist or communist societies, where the means of production are collectively owned or controlled by the state. |
| **Political Systems** | Societies can be categorized based on political systems, such as democracies, monarchies, autocracies, theocracies, or totalitarian regimes. This classification focuses on how power is distributed and exercised within a society. |
| **Social Structures** | Societies can also be categorized based on their social structures. For example, some societies may have hierarchical structures with distinct social classes, while others may have more egalitarian structures. Categorization can consider factors like social mobility, gender roles, and the presence of social institutions like family, education, and religion. |
| **Development Levels** | Societies can be categorized based on their development levels, such as developed, developing, or underdeveloped. This classification often takes into account factors like economic indicators, infrastructure, healthcare, education, and standard of living. |

## Society Tipology

Abstract Classification

| **Society Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Hunter-Gatherer Societies** | Small, nomadic groups relied on hunting, fishing, and gathering for sustenance and lived communally with a limited hierarchy. |
| **Agricultural Societies** | Settled communities focused on agriculture and crop cultivation, the development of surplus and social hierarchies, and the emergence of early civilizations. |
| **Feudal Societies** | Hierarchical structure with monarchs, nobility, and peasants; land-based economy; feudal system with limited social mobility. |
| **Industrial Societies** | Shift to industrialization and urbanization, the rise of factories and manufacturing, increased technological advancements, and the emergence of the working class. |
| **Network Society** | Manuel Castells describes that there has been a shift from an industrial society to an informational society, structured around networks rather than individual actors and characterized by the constant flow of information through technology. |
| **Virtual Society** | A digitally mediated and interconnected socio-cultural environment, where human interactions, activities, and relationships occur predominantly in online or virtual spaces, marking a "Virtual Civilization." |
