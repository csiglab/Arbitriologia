    Key Features:

        Oil Revenue Management: Norway taxes oil and gas profits heavily (78% tax rate) and channels surplus revenues into its Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund (~$1.4 trillion in assets).

        Fiscal Rule: Only 3% of the fund’s value is spent annually to avoid overheating the economy.

        Progressive Taxation: High income and VAT taxes fund welfare services (education, healthcare).

    Why It Works:

        Avoids the "resource curse" by saving oil wealth for future generations.

        Maintains a balanced budget with low public debt (~30% of GDP).
