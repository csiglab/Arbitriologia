## Specialization

> Another Scottish economist, Adam Smith, highlighted the advantages of specialization in a free-market system. Rather than having a group of workers, each producing an entire item from start to finish, Smith explained that it’s usually far more productive to have each of them specialize in one aspect of production. He also cautioned that each worker might not enjoy such a life; this is a trade-off of the specialization model.

> **Note**: The division of labor and specialization move in opposite directions: as the division of labor increases in an economy, the economy tends to diversify.
