## Productivity Metrics

> **Pig Production Productivity** refers to the efficiency  and effectiveness of converting inputs (such as feed, labor, and  resources) into outputs (such as pork, piglets, and by-products).  
Improving productivity is essential for maximizing profitability and  sustainability in pig farming. Below are the **key factors** and **metrics** used to measure and enhance pig production productivity:
> 

### **Key Productivity Metrics**

| **Metric** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR)** | The amount of feed required to produce 1 kg of pig weight gain. Lower FCR = better efficiency. |
| **Average Daily Gain (ADG)** | The average weight gain of pigs per day, measured in grams or kilograms. |
| **Litter Size** | The number of piglets born per litter. Higher litter size = greater productivity. |
| **Weaning to Estrus Interval** | The time between weaning and the sow’s next heat cycle. Shorter interval = higher productivity. |
| **Piglets Weaned per Sow per Year** | The total number of piglets weaned annually per sow. A key measure of reproductive efficiency. |
| **Mortality Rate** | The percentage of pigs that die before reaching market weight. Lower mortality = higher productivity. |
| **Carcass Yield** | The percentage of the pig’s live weight that becomes usable meat. |
| **Return on Investment (ROI)** | The profitability of the farm relative to the total investment. |
