## List of Models


| Model | Description | Key Drivers | Developed By | Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Harrod-Domar Model | Suggests that savings and investment drive economic growth. A higher level of savings leads to higher investment, resulting in economic development. | Savings and Investment | Roy F. Harrod, Evsey Domar | 1930s-1940s |
| Solow-Swan Model | Proposes that technological progress drives economic growth. Technological advancements increase productivity and economic development. | Technological Progress | Robert Solow, Trevor Swan | 1950s-1960s |
| Lewis Model | Argues that economic growth is driven by a shift of labor from the agricultural sector to the industrial sector. Surplus labor in agriculture fuels the growth of the industrial sector, leading to economic development. | Labor Shift (Agriculture to Industry) | Arthur Lewis | 1950s |
| Rostow‚Äôs Stages of Growth | Suggests that economic development occurs in five stages: traditional society, preconditions for takeoff, takeoff, drive to maturity, and high mass consumption. Countries must undergo these stages to achieve economic development. | Sequential Stages of Development | Walt Rostow | 1960s |
| Endogenous Growth Theory | Proposes that economic growth is driven by factors within the economy, such as research and development, education, and technological progress. Government policies can influence these factors, leading to economic growth. | Internal Factors (R&D, Education) | Paul Romer | 1980s |
| Economic Complexity Theory | It suggests that society develops by learning how to make new products and services. The current set of services and products can predict the new products and services that society will learn. | Learning and Innovation | Various Economists | Various Periods |
