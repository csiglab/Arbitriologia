    - **Core Funding**: Some public research institutes receive core funding from government sources, which provides stable support for basic operations, infrastructure maintenance, and administrative costs. Core funding allows institutes to maintain a baseline level of research activity and expertise, even during periods of fluctuating project-based financing.
    - **Endowments and Investment Income**: Public research institutes with established endowments or investment portfolios may generate income from dividends, interest, and capital gains. Endowment funds are typically managed by the institute's foundation or governing board, providing long-term financial stability and flexibility.
- Private Funding - Apply Research
- **Competitive Research Grants**: Public research institutes often compete for research grants from government agencies, private foundations, and international organizations. These grants support specific research projects or initiatives and may cover personnel salaries, equipment purchases, and travel costs.
- Donations
- **Revenue from Intellectual Property**: Public research institutes may generate income from intellectual property (IP) assets such as patents, copyrights, and trademarks resulting from research discoveries and inventions. Licensing agreements, royalties, and equity stakes in spin-off companies can provide a source of funding for future research activities.
