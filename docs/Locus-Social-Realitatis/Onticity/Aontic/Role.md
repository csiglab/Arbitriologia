# **Social Role**

A **Social Role** is not a tangible, ontic object like a tree or a neuron. It is a **relational and emergent construct** that exists within networks of social expectations, interactions, and norms.

A role functions as a **tag of expectation**, denoting patterns of behavior projected onto social agents. It structures interactions, coordinates behavior, and stabilizes social order within a given context.

Its existence is **relational and intersubjective** — arising from shared cognition and mutual recognition among agents. A role both **constrains and enables** action, yet possesses no ontic independence; it exists only through enactment and collective interpretation.

## **Ontology**

> Social Role (SR): An emergent social construct defined by a **shared cognitive state** among agents, **coupled with a structured set of expectations** governing behavior within a social system. SRs are non-ontic but relationally effective, shaping interactions and social outcomes.

* **Abstract yet actionable:** Though intangible, roles constrain and orient agent behavior.
* **Dependent existence:** A role has no independent being; it depends entirely on the continuity of social interaction and recognition.
* **Emergent mode:** Roles emerge and stabilize within distributed networks of cognition and practice, rather than being designed or imposed ex nihilo.

## **Formalism**

A role can be expressed as a contextual expectation mapping:

$R: A \times C \times \mathcal{I} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$

where:

* $A$ — the set of social agents,
* $C$ — the relevant contextual factors (institutional, situational, normative),
* $\mathcal{I}$ — the shared interpretative schema (collective cognition or mutual understanding),
* $\mathcal{B}$ — the distribution of expected behaviors associated with the role.

The actual behavior of an agent enacting a role is **probabilistic**, contingent upon context, interpretation, and feedback from ongoing interaction: $\mathcal{B}_{t+1} = f(R_t, A, C_t, \mathcal{I}_t, \mathcal{B}_t)$

Thus, roles are **recursive** — continuously reshaped by the very behaviors and interpretations they help generate.

## **Limits**

Social roles are **probabilistic, dynamic, and context-sensitive**. Their enactment cannot be captured by deterministic rules; it depends on interpretation, situation, and social feedback.

Roles are fluid: their boundaries, meanings, and expectations shift across contexts and over time. Even formally codified roles (e.g., police officer, teacher, judge) are enacted through variable, interpretative processes rather than algorithmic prescriptions.
