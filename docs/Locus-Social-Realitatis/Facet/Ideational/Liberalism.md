# Liberalism

> Liberalism is a historically evolved meta-institutional configuration that treats morally equal individuals as the primary units of value, legitimizes authority through consent and procedure, constrains coercion via rule-bound law and constitutional design, decentralizes knowledge and coordination through markets and civil society, and manages persistent pluralism by substituting impersonal rules and reversible processes for hierarchical command or substantive moral imposition.

## Formulation

> What is type of ontos is Liberalism?

> Liberalism is not a single theory, ideology, or policy program. Ontologically, it is best characterized as a family of normative–institutional schemas embedded in historical social systems.

> Liberalism is a meta-ideational configuration composed of normative principles, institutional design heuristics, and epistemic commitments that jointly constrain how political, economic, and social coordination is organized.
