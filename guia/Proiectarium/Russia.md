> **Russia** is often portrayed as the invincible military power. And yet,  this reputation is based on two wars - **Napoleonic** and **WWII**. In both  cases **Russia** won only thanks to the alliance allied with *the* leading  economic powerhouse of that era. **Napoleonic Wars** were won only because of the Russian alliance with the **UK**. WWII - only because of the alliance with the US. In both cases the leading economic, industrial and technological power of the age supported Russia, giving it almost unlimited credit and supply line.
