# Property

> A property is an attributive feature or characteristic that can be predicated of an entity, either individually (intrinsic) or in relation to others (relational). Properties do not exist independently, but are instantiated in or by objects, agents, or processes.

## Economic Properties

> In economics, a property often refers to a quantifiable or qualifiable economic attribute:

- **Descriptive Property**: "Price," "income," "utility," "demand," "elasticity"
- **Relational Property**: "Comparative advantage," "market share," "dependency ratio"  
- **Functional Property**: Behaviors or tendencies that affect or are affected by other variables.
- **Emergent Property**: Arises from aggregated interactions.
