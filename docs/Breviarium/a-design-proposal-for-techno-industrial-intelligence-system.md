# A Design Proposal for Techno-industrial Intelligence System

Technology Mapping
– What technologies currently exist globally?
– How are they distributed across countries, industries, and capabilities?

Capability Building
– What does it take to master a given technology (skills, infrastructure, know-how)?
– What are the barriers to localizing or internalizing this technology?

Global Cost Structure
– What is the cost structure of producing industry/product X across different regions?
– Where are the cost advantages, and what factors (labor, capital, energy, regulation) drive them?

Technology Foresight
– What new technologies are emerging that could transform the sector or value chain?
– Which are most likely to become critical in the next 5–15 years?

R&D Strategy
– Which technologies should we prioritize for research and development?
– How should we allocate resources between applied R&D and basic science?

Scientific Exploration
– What areas of basic science are most promising or underexplored?
– How might new scientific discoveries open up novel technological possibilities?
