7. United Arab Emirates (UAE) – Diversification from Oil

    Key Features:

        Shift from Oil to Taxes: Introduced 5% VAT (2018) and corporate tax (2023) to reduce oil dependence.

        Sovereign Wealth Funds: Abu Dhabi’s ADIA ($1 trillion+) invests globally.

        Business-Friendly Policies: Free zones with 0% tax attract multinationals.

    Why It Works:

        Oil revenues still dominant but future-proofing with taxes.

        Low public debt (~15% of GDP).
