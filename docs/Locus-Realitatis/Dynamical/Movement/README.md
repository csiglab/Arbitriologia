# Social Movement

> A social movement is a sustained, organized collective effort by a group of people to promote or resist social, political, economic, or cultural change. It typically arises from shared grievances, values, or identities, and relies on coordinated actions, communication networks, and strategies to influence public opinion, institutions, or policies. Social movements operate outside formal political or organizational hierarchies but can intersect with them to achieve goals.

## Characterization

- Collective action: Involves multiple individuals or groups working together.
- Shared purpose or identity: Participants are motivated by common interests, values, or grievances.
- Sustained effort: Not a one-time event; movements persist over time.
- Goal-oriented: Seeks social, political, cultural, or economic change.
- Extra-institutional influence: Often operates outside formal institutions but may interact with them strategically.
