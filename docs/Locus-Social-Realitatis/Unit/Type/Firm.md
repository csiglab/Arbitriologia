## Organization

### Viable System Model (VSM)

> Let’s use the **Viable System Model (VSM)** to understand how a firm’s internal organization can be structured for adaptability, resilience, and efficient decision-making.

The VSM provides a framework to model an organization as a set of interacting subsystems, each responsible for specific functions: operations, coordination, control, strategy, and environmental scanning. By mapping a firm’s internal structure to these subsystems, we can design recursive and autonomous units that maintain viability in a changing environment.

Key principles of VSM applied to a firm:

1. **System 1 – Operations:** Core activities that produce value.
2. **System 2 – Coordination:** Mechanisms to synchronize and stabilize operations.
3. **System 3 – Control:** Management of resources, performance monitoring, and operational optimization.
4. **System 3* – Audit/Monitoring:** Independent oversight to detect deviations or emerging risks.
5. **System 4 – Strategy & Adaptation:** Environmental scanning, planning, and strategic development.
6. **System 5 – Policy & Identity:** Governance, vision, and the organization’s guiding principles.

Using VSM allows the firm to maintain **structural integrity while adapting dynamically** to internal and external changes.

### Organization Form

| Model | Description | Key Characteristics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Functional | Organized by business functions like HR, Finance, etc. | Specialization, efficiency, clear roles |
| Divisional | Divided by product, market, or geography | Focus on specific markets, flexibility, local optimization |
| Matrix | Combines functional and divisional structures | Dual reporting lines, dynamic resource allocation |
| Flat (or Horizontal) | Few management layers | Fast decision-making, high employee empowerment |
| Network | Relies on a network of external companies or divisions | Focus on core competencies, high adaptability |
| Modular | Outsourced non-core functions | Cost efficiency, flexibility in operations |
| Team-based | Organized around specific projects or workflows | Collaboration, innovation, responsiveness |
| Process-based | Structured around end-to-end processes | Process efficiency, customer focus |
| Holacracy | Self-managing teams without a formal management hierarchy | High agility, employee empowerment, rapid iteration |

## Modelling

> What is a model of a firm? How to model a firm? Why model a firm? Which are the types of models of a firm?

> A model of a firm is a formal, conceptual, or computational representation of the structure, behavior, and purpose of a firm within its environment.

### Motivation

> We always have a kind of mental represntaiton of the firm - infact any entity that we int4eract or ar part of - the uestion will e why have a formal model of the firm instead?

> To model is to think with discipline.

| **Purpose**     | **Description**                                                                                                      |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Explanation** | To understand *why* firms behave as they do — e.g., why they exist, how they organize production, or how they adapt. |
| **Prediction**  | To anticipate outcomes of strategic or environmental changes (e.g., new technologies, market shifts).                |
| **Design**      | To construct or reconfigure firms for improved performance, coordination, or resilience.                             |
| **Control**     | To regulate firm behavior through feedback, monitoring, and policy.                                                  |
| **Learning**    | To test hypotheses, simulate policies, or explore possible futures safely and systematically.                        |

### Praxis

> Modeling a firm begins by asking the right questions — about purpose, scope, representation, and dynamics.

#### Purpose and Intent

- What is the **goal** of the model — explanation, prediction, design, or control?
- What **phenomena** or **problems** do we want the model to illuminate?
- For **whom** is the model being built (researchers, managers, policymakers)?

#### Ontology — What Is the Firm Made Of?

- Which **entities** must the model include? (agents, resources, processes, environment)
- What are the **boundaries** of the firm — where does it begin and end?
- Which aspects are **internal** (organization, decisions) and which are **external** (markets, institutions)?

#### Structure and Mechanisms

- How are the firm’s **elements connected** — through flows, hierarchies, or networks?
- What are the **core mechanisms** (production, coordination, communication, adaptation)?
- How is **information** processed and **decisions** made?

#### Dynamics and Change

- How do **resources**, **outputs**, and **capabilities** evolve over time?
- What **feedback loops** maintain or destabilize the system?
- How does the firm **learn**, **innovate**, or **respond** to environmental shocks?

#### Representation and Formalization

- What type of **modeling language** is appropriate — mathematical, computational, or conceptual?
- How should **time**, **uncertainty**, and **interaction** be represented?
- Which **variables** are observable, and which are latent or emergent?

#### Evaluation and Application

- What constitutes a **good model** in this context — accuracy, explanatory power, or practical insight?
- How can the model be **validated** or **calibrated** using data or observation?
- How can it be used for **simulation**, **design**, or **policy** experimentation?

| **Theory**                    | **Description**                                                                                                                                                               | **Model Structure**                                                                                       |

| **Neoclassical Theory**       | Focuses on profit maximization as the firm's primary objective, assuming perfect competition, full information, and rational actors.                                          | Firm as a *production function*; equilibrium determined by *marginal cost = marginal revenue*.      |
| **Behavioral Theory**         | Proposes that firms seek *satisficing* outcomes rather than optimal ones due to bounded rationality, organizational routines, and imperfect information.                      | Coalition of stakeholders with *aspiration levels*; decision-making modeled as *adaptive search*.   |
| **Managerial Theory**         | Argues that managers pursue goals like sales maximization, growth, or personal utility rather than pure profit, reflecting the separation of ownership and control.           | *Principal–manager* separation; *utility function* includes salary, power, and prestige.            |
| **Agency Theory**             | Analyzes conflicts of interest between principals (owners) and agents (managers), emphasizing *incentive alignment* and the *costs of monitoring and control*.                | Principal–agent model; *contract design* to minimize *agency costs* and *moral hazard*.             |
| **Transaction Cost Theory**   | (Coase, Williamson) Explains firms’ existence as a governance mechanism to minimize the costs of using the market—search, negotiation, and enforcement.                       | Boundary of firm determined by *make-or-buy* decisions; governed by *hierarchies vs. markets*.      |
| **Resource-Based View (RBV)** | Emphasizes internal resources and capabilities as the foundation of competitive advantage—especially those that are valuable, rare, inimitable, and non-substitutable (VRIN). | Firm as a *bundle of resources*; *heterogeneity* and *immobility* explain advantage persistence.    |
| **Evolutionary Theory**       | Views firms as evolving entities whose routines, capabilities, and strategies adapt over time through variation, selection, and retention.                                    | *Dynamic routines* as genes; market as *selection environment*; innovation as *mutation process*.   |
| **Stakeholder Theory**        | Argues that firm behavior reflects the interests of multiple stakeholders—employees, customers, communities, etc.—not only shareholders.                                      | Firm as *stakeholder nexus*; objective function integrates *multi-stakeholder utility*.             |
| **Institutional Theory**      | Examines how formal rules, norms, and cultural expectations shape organizational behavior and legitimacy beyond efficiency considerations.                                    | *Isomorphism* (coercive, mimetic, normative); firm adapts to *institutional environment*.           |
| **Nexus of Contracts Theory** | Conceptualizes the firm as a network of explicit and implicit contracts among self-interested agents coordinating under legal and informational constraints.                  | Firm as *legal fiction*; coordination achieved via *contractual arrangements* instead of hierarchy. |

## Technology

> How do firms incorporate new technical objects? How do they improve, create, or adopt new technical knowledge (technology)?

> Technical Object: Any artifact, tool, system, or material that a firm can use, manipulate, or interact with to perform tasks, produce outputs, or support operations. Examples include machinery, software, instruments, equipment, or digital platforms. A technical object is tangible or instantiated and represents a unit of applied technical knowledge.

> Technology: The knowledge, methods, and practices that allow a firm to create, improve, adopt, or utilize technical objects effectively. Technology is abstract, cognitive, and process-oriented, encompassing both technical know-how and organizational routines for applying that knowledge. It includes inventions, process innovations, technical standards, and expertise embedded in people, systems, or artifacts.

### Innovation

> ¿What is the nature of Private Research? ¿How does the industry innovate? ¿How does industry connect with academia? ¿What are the effects of colocation? ¿When a firm needs In-house research?

> **R&D (Research & Development):**
> Organizational activities aimed at **creating, improving, or adapting technical knowledge, products, or processes**. R&D includes experimentation, prototyping, testing, and knowledge generation. It is the primary mechanism through which firms develop new technologies, enhance existing ones, and explore future capabilities. R&D can be internal, collaborative, or outsourced.

> **Innovation Ecosystem:**
> The **network of actors, institutions, and relationships** that collectively enable, support, and accelerate innovation within and around the firm. This includes suppliers, customers, universities, research centers, regulators, investors, and industry clusters. The ecosystem provides knowledge flows, resources, feedback, and collaborative opportunities that enhance the firm’s capacity to innovate and adopt new technologies.
