# Developmentalism

> Note: Assume the position of an external observer.

> Developmentalism is an epistemological lens with ontological consequences.
It observes the world in a certain way — and by doing so, it helps create institutions that make that world real.

> An observer’s epistemological framework that generates a specific ontological configuration and dynamics.

> Developmentalism, in its most abstract form, is the belief that political actors can deliberately reshape the social and material conditions of their society through coordinated, long-term effort, typically by mobilizing state power, organizing production, and controlling resources. This schema predates capitalism, modernity, and even the nation-state.

> Developmentalism is a cognitive schema that interprets national progress as a structured, stage-based, and attainable transformation, wherein states and societies are viewed as capable of purposeful ascent through coordinated institutional effort.

> **Development** is the dialectical process through which a system (society, polity, or economy) realizes its inherent potential by navigating and resolving internal contradictions. It unfolds as a negation of negation — overcoming previous states (thesis and antithesis) to reach higher levels of complexity and self-awareness. Development is thus not linear or static, but a dynamic movement of becoming, where each stage preserves and transcends what came before, manifesting the system’s self-realization and actualization over time. - [Check This]

## Epistemological Signature

> Developmentalism is a framework of observation and interpretation — a way of seeing and making sense of national and economic progress.

> It acts like an observer or lens, shaping how we understand causality, progress, backwardness, modernity, and transformation.

> Developmentalism is also a cognitive schema — a way of perceiving and interpreting a country’s position in global hierarchies and its capacity for autonomous advancement.

> How and why this cognitive schema (Developmentalism) emerges?

| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Teleological Orientation**     | Assumes a desirable end-state (modernity, industrialization, autonomy) that can be progressively reached.                     |
| **Comparative Positionality**    | Views nations in a developmental hierarchy — “underdeveloped,” “developing,” “developed” — with progress judged relationally. |
| **Agency-Capacity Assumption**   | Presumes that collective, especially state-led, action can alter developmental trajectories.                                  |
| **Historicist Temporality**      | Understands development as a temporal unfolding — history as a process of transformation, not stasis.                         |
| **Problem-Solution Framing**     | Underdevelopment is not natural but a deviation or failure — solvable through policy, reform, or institutional change.        |
| **Rational-Constructivist Bias** | Belief in the power of planning, policy, and institution-building to engineer progress.                                       |
| **National-Scale Cognition**     | The nation-state is the primary unit of analysis and transformation.                                                          |

## Ontological Signature

> You could treat developmentalism as a real system, made up of institutions, state forms, bureaucratic capabilities, ideologies, and class coalitions — i.e., a historically instantiated configuration.

> This moves beyond ideas and into what developmentalism does in the world — how it organizes production, coordinates actors, disciplines capital, structures the state, etc.

> So it's not just a lens, but a material-social arrangement or an institutional complex.

## QA

### How and why does the developmentalist cognitive schema emerge in political and social actors?

> Developmentalism emerges wherever **elites imagine that reality can be can reshape** itself through strategic coordination, resource control, and future orientation.

> The **developmentalist schema doesn't arise spontaneously — it emerges when certain material, symbolic, and experiential thresholds are crossed. These thresholds activate a new kind of political imagination that sees transformation as both possible and necessary.

> The developmentalist cognitive state arises when relative decline, external pressure, or internal crisis combine with elite exposure to alternative models, the capacity to imagine systems, and a belief that the future is malleable. It’s a response to disruption, but one that depends on institutional imagination and symbolic reframing of what the polity is and can become.

| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Relative Backwardness**          | The perception of being behind others (militarily, technologically, economically) provokes a desire to catch up. |
| **External Threat / Pressure**     | War, colonization, or humiliation forces rethinking of internal capacity and strategic self-reliance.            |
| **Exposure to Advanced Systems**   | Elites observe or are educated in more developed societies and import blueprints or comparisons.                 |
| **Demographic or Economic Crisis** | A breakdown in reproduction or governance forces elites to seek alternative systems to maintain order.           |

| **c. 2300 BCE** | Ancient Mesopotamia | Centralized irrigation and temple economies emerge as coordination mechanisms. | Resource scarcity, flooding cycles, need for food surplus, early urbanization. | **Realization of collective action necessity:** The palpable threat of famine and disorder due to unpredictable natural forces. | **Shift to "Managed Interdependence":** Recognition that complex environmental challenges require systematic, centralized planning and coordination beyond individual households for survival and prosperity. Belief in human agency to control nature through organization. |
| **4th–3rd c. BCE** | Warring States, China | Legalist reformers use statecraft to maximize power and agricultural surplus. | Warfare, population pressure, fragmented states, early bureaucracy. | **Perception of existential state fragility:** Intense interstate competition and internal chaos demonstrated the inadequacy of traditional, moralistic governance. | **Shift to "Rationalized State Power":** Belief that a strong, centralized, and scientifically administered state (with clear laws, incentives, and punishments) is the only effective means to ensure order, wealth, and survival. Emphasis on quantifiable results. |
| **3rd c. BCE** | Mauryan Empire (India) | *Arthashastra* outlines a rational state apparatus for managing society. | Imperial formation, agrarian economy, external threats. | **Demand for comprehensive administrative efficacy:** The challenges of governing a vast, newly unified empire required systematic principles for resource mobilization, justice, and defense. | **Shift to "Systemic Governance for Welfare and Power":** Adoption of a detailed, pragmatic framework that views the state as an active instrument for economic regulation, social order, and imperial expansion, based on logical principles rather than solely religious or moral authority. |
| **16th c.** | Tudor England | Strong administrative state, monopolies, navy, and enclosure-based economic strategy. | Dynastic insecurity, religious fragmentation, proto-mercantile growth. | **Crisis of national survival and legitimacy:** Internal religious strife, external threats (Spain), and the need for new revenue sources forced a re-evaluation of the Crown's role. | **Shift to "National Strength Through State Intervention":** Acceptance that the state must actively direct economic activity (e.g., trade, land use) and build military capacity to secure dynastic stability and national prosperity. Concept of "reason of state" emerges. |
| **16th–18th c.** | Mercantilist Europe | Internal production and regulated trade to grow state power and national wealth. | Emerging merchant classes, expanding states, colonialism, proto-industry. | **Intensified inter-state economic rivalry:** The zero-sum perception of global wealth and power fueled a drive for national self-sufficiency and competitive advantage. | **Shift to "Wealth as State Power":** The cognitive framework that national wealth is directly tied to a positive balance of trade and bullion accumulation, requiring extensive state regulation of commerce, industry, and colonies. Governments as active economic managers. |
| **1776–1900s** | United States | Hamiltonian and Jacksonian developmentalism (tariffs, infrastructure, land policies). | Colonial legacy, vast territory, capital scarcity, British competition. | **Recognition of economic vulnerability and potential:** The young nation faced the challenge of consolidating its economic independence and leveraging its vast resources. | **Shift to "Self-Reliance Through Internal Development":** Belief that national strength and prosperity depend on fostering domestic industry, improving internal connectivity, and facilitating westward expansion, often with direct government support and protection. |
| **Mid-19th c.** | Meiji Japan | Rapid modernization to resist Western imperialism through coordinated reform. | Semi-colonial exposure, internal decay, legacy of feudal bureaucracy. | **Acute awareness of national inferiority and existential threat:** The Opium Wars and "unequal treaties" demonstrated a stark power imbalance and the urgent need to catch up with Western industrial and military might. | **Shift to "Catch-Up Modernization for Survival":** A collective realization that radical, top-down reforms across all sectors (military, education, industry, governance) were essential to preserve national sovereignty and achieve parity with Western powers. Focus on learning and adaptation. |
| **1920s–40s** | USSR | Planned economy and forced industrialization under socialist state ideology. | Agrarian base, geopolitical isolation, civil war aftermath. | **Ideological imperative and perceived encirclement:** The Bolshevik commitment to a socialist future combined with the threat of capitalist intervention necessitated a radical departure from market mechanisms. | **Shift to "Total State Planning for Rapid Transformation":** Adoption of a command economy schema, believing that only comprehensive, centralized planning and forced resource allocation could achieve rapid industrialization and agricultural collectivization, overcoming historical backwardness and external threats. |
| **1930s–70s** | United States (New Deal–Cold War) | Keynesian developmentalism: infrastructure, science, and social welfare. | Economic depression, global war, geopolitical competition. | **Failure of laissez-faire and demand for collective security:** The Great Depression revealed the limits of unregulated capitalism, while WWII and the Cold War necessitated massive state coordination. | **Shift to "Managed Capitalism for Stability and Supremacy":** Acceptance that the state has a vital role in stabilizing the economy, fostering technological innovation, and providing social safety nets, not just for domestic well-being but also for national security and global leadership. |
| **1960s–90s** | South Korea & Taiwan | Export-led growth directed by authoritarian technocratic states. | Cold War funding, small internal markets, legacy of colonial infrastructure. | **Lessons from successful industrialization and geopolitical necessity:** Observation of Japan's success and the strategic need for economic strength in a Cold War context. | **Shift to "Technocratic Export-Oriented Growth":** Adoption of a highly disciplined and strategic approach where the state actively guides specific industries towards export competitiveness, leveraging human capital and external support, with a strong belief in economic planning. |
| **1978–present** | China | Strategic liberalization under one-party control; state-capitalist synthesis. | Maoist legacy, Cold War economy, massive rural underemployment. | **Recognition of Maoist economic stagnation and potential for reform:** The severe economic backwardness post-Mao created an imperative for change to maintain Party legitimacy and national strength. | **Shift to "Pragmatic State-Led Marketization":** A new cognitive framework that allows for market mechanisms and foreign investment under strong state control, prioritizing economic growth and stability as the path to national power and improved living standards. "Crossing the river by feeling the stones." |
| **2000s–present** | Ethiopia, Rwanda | Developmental states with strong centralized control and elite technocratic planning. | Post-genocide/post-war recovery, aid dependence, agrarian foundations. | **Urgent need for stability and development post-conflict:** The devastating impact of conflict created a clear mandate for strong leadership and rapid progress to prevent recurrence and improve livelihoods. | **Shift to "Authoritarian Developmentalism for Stability and Progress":** Belief that robust, centralized state control, combined with technocratic planning and often leveraging international aid, is the most effective means to achieve rapid economic development and national cohesion after periods of severe upheaval. |
