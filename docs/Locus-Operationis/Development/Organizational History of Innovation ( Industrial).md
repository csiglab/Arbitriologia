- What is the distribution of the number of people participating  in innovation or patent development over time, and how does this  distribution vary across different stages of the innovation process?

| **Century** | **Innovation Context** | **Typical Number of Participants** | **Key Stages of Innovation** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **18th (XVIII)** | **Pre-Industrial Revolution**: Innovations were often individual or small-group efforts. | 1-5 | - Ideation<br>- Prototyping<br>- Basic testing | Innovations were largely artisan-driven (e.g., James Watt's steam engine). |
| **19th (XIX)** | **Industrial Revolution**: Rise of factories and organized R&D. | 5-50 | - Ideation<br>- R&D<br>- Design & Engineering<br>- Early commercialization | Collaboration increased with industrialization (e.g., Edison's Menlo Park lab). |
| **20th (XX)** | **Mass Production & Corporate R&D**: Large-scale innovation in corporations and labs. | 50-500+ | - Ideation<br>- R&D<br>- Design & Engineering<br>- Testing & Validation<br>- Manufacturing | Rise of industrial labs (e.g., Bell Labs, Xerox PARC) and government-funded research. |
| **21st (XXI)** | **Global Collaboration & Digital Age**: Open innovation, global teams, and AI-driven R&D. | 10-1000+ | - Ideation<br>- R&D<br>- Design & Engineering<br>- Testing<br>- Manufacturing<br>- Post-market surveillance | Distributed teams, open-source projects, and AI tools enable large-scale collaboration. |
