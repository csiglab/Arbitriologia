# Arbitreria

> This document explores the foundational elements of social systems—common loci where social interactions, norms, and institutions emerge and converge. It aims to provide a conceptual framework to understand the patterns and structures underlying collective human behavior.

> **Note:** In this document, the Spanish neologism **“Gobernata”** will be used to denote **policy**—understood as the strategic coordination and implementation of governance—while **“Política”** will refer to **politics**, understood as the process of power negotiation, representation, and ideological contestation. This distinction is introduced to clarify a conceptual gap in the Spanish language, where the terms *política* and *política pública* often blur the line between the formulation of power and its administrative execution.

> Note: Praxis gubernandi will denote statecraft.
