> Too many projects,  goals unrealistic (from 42% to 70% of local pharmaceuticals in 4 years ??);  lack of a great & clear institutional design; bad policy framework (did not take a clearly multi-dimensional approach) -lack of transparency - should have a side at least (for the public / not black art policies).
