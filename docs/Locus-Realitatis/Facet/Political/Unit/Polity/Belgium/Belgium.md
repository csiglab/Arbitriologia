## üìú Economic History

| **Period**            | **Key Events and Developments** |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Pre-modern Era**    | Medieval trade hubs (Bruges, Ghent, Antwerp) under Burgundian rule; textile guilds; Hanseatic League connections. |
| **Colonial/Imperial Era** | No overseas colonies; territory repeatedly contested by Spain, Austria, France, Netherlands; Antwerp port declined under Dutch blockade (1585). |
| **Industrialization** | First continental country to industrialize (1820s-1860s); coal deposits in Wallonia drive heavy industry; world-leading in locomotives, steel, glass. |
| **Post-war Development** | 1944-1958: Marshall Plan, Benelux Customs Union, European Coal & Steel Community; ‚Äúmiracle belge‚Äù 1945-1970 (5.5 % annual GDP growth). |
| **Contemporary Era**  | 1970s-1980s: decline of Walloon heavy industry; Flemish ports and services rise; 1999-2002 euro adoption; 2008 crisis hit banking (Dexia, Fortis); 2020s green transition & digitalization. |

**Guiding Questions:**  

- Coal + waterways ‚Üí early industrial advantage.  
- Colonialism limited; instead, strategic location at Rhine-Scheldt delta.  
- Shift from Walloon heavy industry to Flanders logistics & services.  
- EU integration cushioned shocks but exposed fragility of oversized banking sector.

## Industrial Policy during Industrialization (early 1800s‚Äì1900)

>  Yes, Belgium implemented several **forms of industrial policy during its period of industrialization**, particularly in the **19th
century**, making it one of the **first countries in continental Europe to industrialize**‚Äîsecond only to Britain.

> Before industrialization, Belgium‚Äôs productive structure was characterized by a predominantly agrarian economy with decentralized artisanal production, proto-industrial textile manufacturing in rural households (notably linen and wool), and regionally specialized sectors like coal extraction in Wallonia, operating under feudal land tenure patterns and limited market integration, but with latent infrastructural and institutional conditions‚Äîsuch as early canal networks and access to British technology‚Äîthat facilitated a rapid transition to mechanized industry.

Belgium **did not have a centralized, formal industrial policy** like modern industrial strategies, but it \*\*used a coordinated mix of:

- Infrastructure investment,
* Banking/financial institutions,
* Technical education,
* Selective trade protection,
  to **create the conditions for industrial take-off**.

1. **Proactive State Role in Infrastructure**

* **Railroads**: The Belgian state financed and built a national railway network early (from the 1830s). By 1840, it had one of the densest railway systems in Europe. The state connected coal and steel-producing regions (like Wallonia) to ports and cities.
* **Canals and Roads**: Continued investment in inland waterways and roads facilitated transport of heavy industrial goods.

2. **Banking and Finance Support**

* **Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale** (1822): Founded by King William I of the Netherlands (before Belgian independence), this powerful mixed bank provided long-term credit to industry and played a quasi-industrial policy role.
* Financing was directed toward **coal mining, steelworks, glass**, and **mechanical industries**, especially in Wallonia.

3. **Protectionist Tariff Measures**

* While Belgium was more liberal than France, it still **used tariffs selectively** in the early period to protect budding industries, particularly **textiles and metalworking**.
* Later on, **bilateral trade agreements** underpinned export strategies, especially with France and Germany.

4. **Technical Education and Training**

* The state **invested in technical schools** and **engineering institutions**, particularly in Wallonia.
* Example: **√âcole des Mines** and other specialized institutions trained the skilled workforce needed in coal and steel sectors.

5. **Clustered Development in Wallonia**

* The state **didn‚Äôt plan clusters per se**, but its infrastructure and credit policies **favored the emergence of the Sillon industriel** (Industrial Valley) in Wallonia: Charleroi, Li√®ge, and Mons.
* This region specialized in **coal, steel, glass, and rail equipment** production.

6. **Innovation Promotion (indirect)**

* Though the state did not have a formal R\&D policy, **private-public partnerships and bank-industry alliances** (e.g., with Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale) promoted **technology transfer**, particularly from Britain.

## Manpower Training

> By 1900 Belgium had the **densest per-capita network of technical schools** on the continent, feeding **foremen, draughtsmen and junior engineers** directly into coal mines, ironworks, locomotive plants and textile mills‚Äîprecisely the skills required to maintain the **second-highest industrial density in the world** after Britain .

### University-level engineering

- **Universit√© de Li√®ge (State)** ‚Äì opened **1835** with a Faculty of Applied Sciences; by the 1860s housed laboratories for mining, metallurgy and civil engineering.  
- **Ghent State University** ‚Äì created **1830**; added mechanical-engineering courses (1860s) to serve the Flemish textile belt.  
- **Catholic University of Louvain & Free University of Brussels** ‚Äì both founded engineering sections in the 1860s, often competing for industry contracts .

### Higher technical ‚Äúgrandes √©coles‚Äù

- **√âcole des Mines de Mons** ‚Äì founded **1838**, training mining engineers for the Borinage and Li√®ge coal basins.  
- **√âcole des Arts et Manufactures (later √âcole Centrale)** ‚Äì launched **Li√®ge 1838**, **Ghent 1838**, **Huy 1838**, **Verviers 1841**, **Charleroi 1845**; curricula combined **mathematics, mechanics, chemistry and drawing** with **evening classes** so that foremen and master-craftsmen could attend while working .  
- **Antwerp Industrial School** ‚Äì opened **1866**; four-year programme (extended to five in 1894) with branches in **materials science, construction, ship-building and wood-working**; modelled on Li√®ge and German schools .

### Network of industrial & vocational schools

| Year | Number of schools | Typical location | Focus |
|------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| 1850 | 12 | Li√®ge, Ghent, Verviers | Textile, mining, iron |
| 1897 | 40 | Hainaut (18), Charleroi, Namur, Antwerp | Coal, steel, glass, mechanical construction  |

Classes were **evening or winter courses** (Oct‚ÄìMar) so apprentices could keep daytime jobs; curricula included **projective geometry, machine drawing, mechanics and basic chemistry** .

### State & private funding

- Municipalities and provincial councils provided buildings; the **Ministry of Industry & Labour** issued national **programme regulations** (1867, 1872, 1894) and paid part-time teachers .  
- Catholic and municipal **vocational schools** complemented the industrial schools, offering strictly practical day-time training for younger workers.
## Summary

Belgium‚Äôs industrial take-off rested on three mutually reinforcing layers:

- Factor endowment: cheap coal + iron ore in the Sillon industriel
- Institutional finance: Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale de Belgique (SG) provided risk capital, long-term credit and equity markets
- State-backed coordination: tariffs, railway charters, patent law, canal and rail concessions, technical education
