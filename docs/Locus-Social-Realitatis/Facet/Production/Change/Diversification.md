# Economic Diversification


> How does path dependency affect diversification? Why are some diversification paths more valuable when converging with the technological frontier?
> 

> Diversification path models in economics explore the dynamics of economic diversification within an economy. Economic diversification refers to the process by which a country or region broadens its economic base by expanding into new sectors or industries.


> Different models and theories have been proposed to understand economic diversification's patterns, determinants, and consequences.


> **Diversification in an economy** refers to the strategy of expanding the range of industries, products, or services to reduce reliance on a single sector, thereby spreading risk and fostering long-term stability and growth.

- How to enter a market?
- ¿How to map value chains and supply chains for that market?
- ¿How to improve the quality of products and services?
    - Certifications
    - Regulations
- ¿How to promote exports for foreign markets?

Here are some notable diversification path models:

1. **Product Space Models:** 
    - **Hausmann-Klinger Model:** Developed by Ricardo Hausmann and Cesar A. Hidalgo, this model uses the concept of product space to analyze the capabilities of economies and predict their future diversification paths.
2. **Structural Transformation Models:**
    - **Lewis Two-Sector Model:** Proposed by economist Arthur Lewis, this model suggests that economic development involves shifting labor from traditional, low-productivity sectors to modern, high-productivity sectors.
    - **Kaldor-Verdoorn Law:** This law suggests a positive feedback loop between productivity growth and expanding an economy's industrial base.
3. **Export-Led Growth Models:**
    - **Balassa-Samuelson Model:** This model explains the relationship between the structure of an economy, productivity, and the real exchange rate, influencing the pattern of specialization and diversification.
    - **Prebisch-Singer Hypothesis:** This hypothesis posits a tendency for the prices of primary commodities to fall relative to the prices of manufactured goods over the long term, affecting diversification strategies.
4. **Innovation and Technology Diffusion Models:**
    - **Product Life Cycle Model:** Introduced by Raymond Vernon, this model explains the internationalization of industries based on the life cycle of new products.
    - **Romer's Endogenous Growth Model:** Developed by Paul Romer, this model emphasizes the role of knowledge and innovation in driving economic growth and diversification.
5. **Institutional and Policy-Driven Models:**
    - **Institutional Path Dependence:** This perspective highlights the influence of historical institutions and policies on shaping the trajectory of economic diversification.
    - **Industrial Policy Models:** These models emphasize the role of targeted government interventions and industrial policies in fostering economic diversification.

When exploring these models, it's essential to consider that each economy is unique, and the applicability of these models may vary based on specific circumstances. Additionally, interdisciplinary approaches that integrate insights from economics, sociology, political science, and other fields can provide a more comprehensive understanding of economic diversification paths.

## **Smart Specialization**

> Here's a table summarizing critical economic **Smart Specialization Models**, including their main concepts and objectives:
> 

| **Model** | **Main Concepts and Objectives** |
| --- | --- |
| **RIS3 (Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation)** | - A strategic approach to economic development through targeted support for research and innovation.<br>- Focuses on identifying and exploiting regional strengths and opportunities.<br>- Aims to enhance competitiveness and growth through innovation-driven activities. |
| **Cluster-Based Model** | - Encourages the development of regional clusters of interconnected businesses, suppliers, and associated institutions.<br>- Promotes collaboration and innovation within clusters to drive economic growth.<br>- Focuses on specialization in specific industries or technologies. |
| **Triple Helix Model** | - Emphasizes collaboration between universities, industry, and government to foster innovation and economic development.<br>- Aims to create synergies between different sectors to enhance knowledge transfer and commercialization of research. |
| **Entrepreneurial Discovery Process (EDP)** | - Involves stakeholders in identifying potential growth and innovation areas through an inclusive and iterative process.<br>- Encourages experimentation and investment in new ideas and technologies.<br>- Aims to align regional capabilities with market opportunities. |
| **Innovation Ecosystems Model** | - Focuses on creating supportive environments for innovation through the integration of various actors, including startups, research institutions, and investors.<br>- Promotes the development of networks and infrastructures that facilitate innovation and entrepreneurship.<br>- Aims to create sustainable and dynamic ecosystems that drive economic growth. |
| **Technological Platforms Model** | - Supports the development of technology platforms that bring together stakeholders to collaborate on R&D and innovation projects.<br>- Aims to address common technological challenges and opportunities through shared efforts.<br>- Focuses on fostering technological advancements and commercialization. |
| **Quadruple Helix Model** | - Extends the Triple Helix Model by incorporating civil society as a key actor in the innovation process.<br>- Aims to ensure that innovation is socially inclusive and addresses broader societal needs.<br>- Promotes collaboration between universities, industry, government, and civil society. |

These models highlight different approaches to fostering innovation and economic development by leveraging regional strengths, promoting collaboration, and supporting targeted investments in research and innovation.
