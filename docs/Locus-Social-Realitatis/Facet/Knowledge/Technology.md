# Technology

> In this note, we explore the notion of technology—a concept of great importance, yet one often surrounded by ambiguity, reductionism, and confusion. Understanding what technology truly signifies is essential for clarifying its role in development, policy, and the organization of productive systems.

## On Notions of Technology

> What are the various levels at which the same element can be understood? How is technology commonly understood? What are the limits of this understanding?

> Note: Among the lay public, the most common notion—or level of understanding—of the element denoted by the word technology is that of tools, gadgets, and devices. This level of understanding, however, is not useful for development policy, as it focuses on the **results** of **technical research** rather than on the whole process—from technical research, through **technical constructs**, to **technical objects** des    igned for consumption or for enabling production—and on the social organization that sustains and evolves around it.

Notions:

1. Lay Public: Technology is seen as modern tools, gadgets, and machines — tangible symbols of progress and convenience. It is equated with innovation or advancement, often stripped of context, technique, or systemic interdependence.
2. Economist: Technology is treated as a production factor or productivity driver, often modeled as an exogenous variable in growth functions (e.g., “technological progress” in the Solow model). It is equated with efficiency, innovation, or knowledge capital.
3. Sociologist: Technology is viewed as a social construct and mediator — a network of human and non-human actors (Latour, Callon) or as material culture shaping behavior and institutions.
4. Engineer: Technology is understood as a body of applied knowledge — the systematic use of scientific principles to design and operate technical systems.

## Formulation

> What is **Technology**? Technology is a somewhat complex notion that can be best deconstructed into two main components: Technical Objects and Techniques—with Techniques further divided into Constitutive Techniques and Operative Techniques.

> **Technical Objects**: These are physical or digital artifacts, systems, or devices created to perform specific functions or tasks. They embody constitutive techniques that enable their operation and serve as the material manifestation of technology, making techniques usable in practical contexts.

> Technology: Technical Research -> Technique -> Technique Used.

> Innovation: The transformatio of the transformation.  **(X → Y) → (X → better Y); AKA**  tech R&D.

## Technical Research

> What is Technical Research? Technical Research refers to the systematic inquiry into the underlying principles, mechanisms, and possibilities of technical functioning—that is, into the ways by which matter, energy, or information can be transformed, controlled, or organized to achieve desired outcomes.

> What is the output of Technical Research? It yeild new technique(s).

> What is its relation with innovation in firms? Technical Research provides the technical foundation upon which innovation builds. It expands the space of technical possibilities that firms can later apply, combine, or commercialize. In other words, innovation draws upon the results of technical research to create new products, processes, or services that generate economic or strategic value.

> How does it differ from innovation in firms? Technical Research aims to discover and validate new techniques, while innovation aims to apply and exploit those techniques in practical or market contexts.

| Aspect | **Technical Research** | **Innovation in Firms** |
|--------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Purpose** | Expand technical knowledge and feasibility. | Apply technical knowledge for competitive or market advantage. |
| **Output** | New or improved techniques. | New or improved products, services, or business models. |
| **Evaluation** | Technical validity, novelty, and performance. | Market adoption, profitability, and impact. |
| **Orientation** | Exploratory, knowledge-generating. | Applied, value-generating. |
| **Temporal Role** | Precedes and enables innovation. | Implements and commercializes research outcomes. |

## Technique

> What is a technique? What are the types of technique(s)?

> A **technique** is a structured method of action that mobilizes knowledge, tools, and materials to produce a determined transformation in matter, energy, or information.

> Technical Knowledge: It is knowledge  and mastery of a technique. It combines understanding how something works with the practical ability to apply it effectively. In other words, it is both know-how and skill embedded in the use or creation of technical objects and processes.

> Note: Genetic Modification is not a technical object (it’s not a thing you manipulate in the world by itself), and it’s not an operative technique (unless you count a specific lab protocol). It’s a constitutive technique, part of the deep technical knowledge that underlies applied operations.

> A **constitutive technique** does not need to underlie only technical objects; it can also directly underpin processes or methods, such as genetic modification.

| **Type**                   | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                     | **Case(s)**                                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Constitutive Technique** | Underlie the technical objects that enable production—they are built into the object’s functioning or structure.                                                                                                    | Doping in semiconductors, alloying in metallurgy, fermentation in bioprocessing.                   |
| **Operative Technique**    | Govern the use, operation, and coordination of those objects within productive systems.                                                                                                                             | CNC machine operation, assembly-line balancing, reactor control.                                   |

## QA

### Why is a bicycle a technical object?

A bicycle is a technical object because it is a designed artifact that embodies techniques and materials to perform a specific function—transporting a person efficiently.

### Which products are not technical objects?

> Products that exist in their natural state or require no applied techniques to function are not considered technical objects.

Examples include:

- Water without any processing
- Fresh fruits and vegetables
- Raw minerals or unprocessed natural resources
