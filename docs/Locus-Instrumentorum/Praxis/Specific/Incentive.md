# Incentive

> An **incentive** is an *action → feedback* pair, designed to influence an agent’s future behavior by linking actions to consequences such as rewards or penalties.

> An **Alignment** seeks to direct human action toward outcomes that are consistent with a system’s goals, values, or desired states—without necessarily prescribing each individual behavior.
