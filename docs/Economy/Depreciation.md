Below is a table summarizing the most common **depreciation methods** or models used in accounting and finance.

Each method has its own formula, application, and impact on financial statements.

| **Depreciation Method** | **Formula** | **Application** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Straight-Line (SL)** | $\text{Depreciation Expense} = \frac{\text{Cost} - \text{Salvage Value}}{\text{Useful Life}}$ | Evenly distributes depreciation over the asset's useful life. | Simple to calculate; consistent expense recognition. | May not reflect actual usage or wear and tear. |
| **Declining Balance (DB)** | $\text{Depreciation Expense} = \text{Book Value} \times \text{Depreciation Rate}$ | Accelerates depreciation, with higher expenses in early years. | Matches higher expenses with higher revenue in early years. | More complex; may not fully depreciate the asset to salvage value. |
| **Double Declining Balance (DDB)** | $\text{Depreciation Expense} = 2 \times \text{Straight-Line Rate} \times \text{Book Value}$ | A more aggressive form of declining balance depreciation. | Faster write-off of asset value; useful for assets that lose value quickly. | Can over-depreciate assets; requires switching to straight-line in later years. |
| **Units of Production (UOP)** | $\text{Depreciation Expense} = \frac{\text{Cost} - \text{Salvage Value}}{\text{Total Units}} \times \text{Units Produced}$ | Depreciates based on actual usage or production output. | Matches depreciation to actual usage; fair for machinery or vehicles. | Requires tracking of usage; not suitable for all assets. |
| **Sum-of-the-Years'-Digits (SYD)** | $\text{Depreciation Expense} = \frac{\text{Remaining Life}}{\text{SYD}} \times (\text{Cost} - \text{Salvage Value})$ | Accelerates depreciation, but less aggressive than declining balance methods. | Front-loads depreciation; useful for tax purposes. | More complex to calculate than straight-line. |
| **MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System)** | Based on IRS tables for asset classes. | Used for tax purposes in the U.S.; combines declining balance and straight-line. | Maximizes tax benefits in early years. | Complex; only applicable for tax reporting, not financial reporting. |
