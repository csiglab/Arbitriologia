# Economic Research

> An **economic system** is a way in which a society organizes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. It encompasses the rules, institutions, and relationships that govern economic activity within a society.

## Ontological Scaffold

> This scaffold captures the fundamental ontological elements underlying economic science, allowing for the comparison of different schools of thought through their assumptions about human behavior, institutions, coordination, and systemic transformation.

### Economic Interaction Space

> An **action space** refers to the set of all possible actions or choices that an agent or decision-maker can take in a given situation or environment. It represents the range of options available to an entity when making decisions or performing actions to achieve a specific goal or objective.
> 

- How can we alter society so that some goals are achieved?
- How do changes in economic policies affect consumer behavior?
- What is the optimal tax policy to promote economic efficiency and equity?
- What are behavioral macroeconomics' implications for monetary and fiscal policy, and how can policy be designed to account for economic behavioral factors?

Types of Actions:

| **Type of Action** | **Description** | **Type of Actor** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Meta/Policy Actions** | Setting the action space or influencing the decisions and behaviors of other economic agents. | Government, Regulatory Bodies, Policy Makers |
| **Produce** | Creating goods or services by transforming inputs (raw materials, labor, capital) into valuable outputs. | Firms, Producers, Individuals |
| **Learn** | Acquiring knowledge, skills, and information to improve productivity, adapt to changes, and enhance decision-making. | Individuals, Educational Institutions, Firms |
| **Consumption** | Using goods or services to satisfy personal or household needs and desires. | Individuals, Households |
| **Distribute** | Allocating goods and services from producers to consumers involves activities by wholesalers, retailers, and logistics providers. | Wholesalers, Retailers, Logistics Providers |
| **Linkage** | Connecting different sectors, industries, or financial activities to facilitate the flow of goods, services, information, or capital. | Firms, Financial Institutions, Industries |
| **Collaborate** | Working with other firms or organizations to achieve strategic goals through joint ventures or partnerships. | Firms, Organizations, Joint Ventures |
| **Financial Actions Space** | Managing financial resources, including borrowing, lending, and investing. | Individuals, Firms, Financial Institutions |

| **Monitor** | Tracking and analyzing economic activities and performance to meet objectives and adjust strategies as needed. | Firms, Regulatory Bodies, Analysts |
| **Adjust** | Modifying strategies, production processes, or policies in response to changing conditions or feedback. | Firms, Governments, Individuals |


## Economic Modelling

> **Modelling Tools**: Economic Phenomena → Model.
> 

> Let say  we have  **product**, **resource** “something with value (subjective)”, service **x**;   by the **economics** of **x;** we mean a **characterization of the systems** that allows x to go from **H** owner to **W** wanted? Productive Knowledge, Supply, Demand, Market Structure, Risk, Return, Regulations, Elasticity, Externalities, Market Failures, Infra-structure (Energy, Transportation, …)
> 

> The economics of **x;**   can also mean how affect affect **economic processes** like economic decision making , etc.
> 



> Economic models are ‘effective theories’;  they don’t  model  how exactly  model the underlying system exactly; see the **as if principle**.
> 

> An **economic model** is a theoretical construct designed to analyze the behavior of economic agents using quantitative and logical methods.
> 

> A model can be **formulated** **verbally and/or in the form of equations and/or diagrams** and is composed of a list of variables that characterize the economic agents and the economic environment under considerations, and a list of assumptions about constraints and choices.
> 

> An economic model is always a **simplified representation of the real world**, and the choice of the degree of simplifmicroications is dictated by the focus of the research and the aviability of relevant information.
> 

> To understand the economy of a moment is to deeply understand the productive forefront of that moment. - Roberto Unger.
> 

> **Dynamics**: Dynamics in economics refer to the evolving and interactive processes by which economic variables, such as prices, outputs, and employment, change over time in response to various factors, shaping the overall behavior of an economic system.
> 

> **Holism**: Holism in an economic system embodies the perspective that the entire economic structure is an integrated and interconnected entity, emphasizing the importance of studying the system as a whole rather than focusing solely on individual components.
> 

> The e**ndogeneity principl**e in economics posits that certain variables or factors within an economic model are determined by the system itself, considering internal interactions and feedback loops, rather than being externally imposed.
> 

> **Exogeneity principle** in economics asserts that certain variables or factors are treated as external and unaffected by the economic system under consideration, often used to distinguish between endogenous variables influenced by the model and exogenous variables considered as given inputs.
> 

> **Synergy** is an interaction or cooperation giving rise to a whole greater than the simple sum of its parts. The term synergy comes from the Attic Greek word συνεργία synergia from synergos, συνεργός, meaning “working together”. https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Synergy; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9131462/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9125226/
> 

> **Feedback**:  Economic feedback refers to the dynamic and interactive process in which changes in one economic variable or factor lead to subsequent effects that may either reinforce (positive feedback) or counteract (negative feedback) the initial change, creating a cyclical or self-reinforcing pattern within an economic system. Feedback mechanisms play a crucial role in shaping the behavioreconoic and stability of economic processes, influencing factors such as production, consumption, investment, and overall economic performance.

> **Coevolution**: **Coevolution** as a modeling principle simultaneously simulates the dynamic reciprocal interactions and adaptations between multiple entities or variables, capturing the mutual influence that shapes their evolving behaviors or characteristics.

| **Level of Analysis** | **Focus** | **What it Examines** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Micro Level** | Behavior and decisions of individuals or firms | How households and firms decide what to produce, consume, and invest in; interactions that determine market outcomes such as prices and quantities. |
| **Meso Level** | Behavior and decisions of groups (industries or regional economies) | Competition among firms in a particular industry; effects of economic policies on the performance of specific regions. |
| **Macro Level** | Overall performance of the economy | Trends in key economic indicators such as GDP, inflation, and unemployment; factors driving these trends; role of government policies in shaping the economy. |

### External Observer Pitfalls

| **Pitfall**                         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Snapshot Fallacy**                | Treating the present configuration of institutions, technology, and power as a timeless, exogenous frame.                                                       |
| **Universalization of Contingency** | Elevating a historically specific pattern (e.g., price-responsiveness) to a context-free “law.”                                                                 |
| **Structure-Naturalization**        | Reifying emergent outcomes (e.g., wages, interest rates, “efficiency”) as natural or inevitable rather than socially produced and contested.                    |
| **Exogenous-Variable Smuggling**    | Hiding key drivers (e.g., state capacity, class relations, colonial history) outside the model boundary.                                                        |
| **Equilibrium Fixation**            | Assuming a stable equilibrium point instead of modeling a dynamic, path-dependent, or out-of-equilibrium process.                                               |
| **Feedback Neglect**                | Omitting positive/negative feedback, threshold effects, or phase transitions that can lead to nonlinear or emergent behavior.                                   |
| **Logical-Time Fallacy**            | Operating in logical or comparative-static time while ignoring real historical time, irreversibility, or temporal sequencing.                                   |
| **Agent-Structure Dualism**         | Treating agents’ preferences and beliefs as fixed and exogenous, rather than institutionally shaped and historically mutable.                                   |
| **Power & Coercion Invisibility**   | Leaving out power asymmetries, domination, and enforcement that underlie and stabilize formal “market” outcomes.                                                |
| **Ontological Reification**         | Mistaking surface regularities or system states (e.g., price stability) for deep causal rules or laws.                                                          |
| **Policy-Local Optimization Trap**  | Offering technocratic optimizations within a fixed structure, without addressing how the structure itself shapes constraints and incentives.                    |
| **End-State Teleology**             | Assuming the current system is a natural or desirable endpoint rather than a contingent, contested configuration.                                               |
| **Scale Confusion**                 | Conflating micro-level dynamics with macro-level regularities, or assuming that what holds for individuals applies at systemic scales (fallacy of composition). |
| **Institutional Blindness**         | Ignoring how rules, norms, and enforcement structures co-constitute economic behavior and outcomes.                                                             |
| **Axiomatic Overreach**             | Elevating theoretical axioms (e.g., rational expectations, utility maximization) into unquestioned truths, resistant to empirical challenge.                    |
| **Abstraction-Opacity Drift**       | Allowing highly abstract models to become so removed from empirical anchors that their assumptions are no longer inspectable or interpretable.                  |
| **Homogeneity Assumption**          | Assuming agent or sectoral homogeneity where real-world systems show diversity, conflict, and specialization.                                                   |
| **Boundary Framing Bias**           | Drawing the boundary of the system to exclude inconvenient variables, domains, or disciplines (e.g., environment, care work, informal sector).                  |
| **Tool Reification**                | Confusing methodological convenience (e.g., linear regression, representative agents) with ontological accuracy.                                                |
| **Failure to Model Reflexivity**    | Ignoring how agents adapt, anticipate, and respond to models, policies, or expectations—altering the very dynamics being modeled.                               |

## Historic of Economic Thought

> **Ideas** as the main drivers of economic policy; in the approach of “development“  there  is usually a “conceptual“ error (e.g lack of awareness of the nature and importance of technological and research infra-structure) that understand development  in **neo-classical** terms, not as structural transformation,  and evolutionary modes.
> 

> Praxis ← →  Theory: Look at the practices;  theories and interactions.
> 

> Here is a table tracing the **history of manufacturing as the source of wealth** through various economic and philosophical perspectives:
> 
- How are ideas acquired?
- Which models of diffusion of ideas we have?
- Can we infer when established ideas will show up in a society?

| **Period** | **Thinker/School** | **Contribution/Key Idea** | **Key Work** | **Impact on the Concept of Manufacturing as Wealth** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Ancient Times** | **Plato** | Valued agriculture and handicrafts but saw commerce as secondary to virtue. | *Republic* | Manufacturing seen as necessary but not central to societal wealth. |
| **Ancient Times** | **Aristotle** | Distinguished between natural wealth (necessary goods) and artificial wealth (commerce, money). | *Politics* | Focused more on the ethical implications of wealth rather than on manufacturing as a source of wealth. |
| **Late Medieval** | **Scholasticism** | Emphasized just pricing in commerce, less focus on manufacturing. | N/A | Manufacturing's role in wealth generation was modest, overshadowed by ethical debates on trade. |
| **16th Century** | **Antonio Serra** | Argued for a favorable balance of trade based on manufacturing over raw materials. | *Breve trattato delle cause* (1613) | First to argue that manufacturing, especially in urban areas, could generate greater wealth than agriculture. |
| **17th Century** | **Mercantilists (e.g., Colbert)** | Advocated that national wealth is generated by maximizing exports of manufactured goods and limiting imports. | N/A (Colbert's policies in France) | Strongly pushed for state-controlled manufacturing, seeing it as a path to national prosperity. |
| **18th Century** | **William Petty** | Promoted the idea that manufacturing and labor contributed to the wealth of nations. | *Political Arithmetick* (1690) | Quantified the contributions of manufacturing to national wealth, a precursor to modern economic thought. |
| **18th Century** | **François Quesnay (Physiocrats)** | Saw agriculture as the only true source of wealth, downplaying the role of manufacturing. | *Tableau économique* (1758) | Rejected the centrality of manufacturing in favor of agriculture, contrasting with mercantilist thought. |
| **18th Century** | **Adam Smith** | Argued that division of labor in manufacturing leads to greater productivity and thus wealth. | *The Wealth of Nations* (1776) | Rejected mercantilism, stating that manufacturing and labor (through specialization) create wealth more than trade balances. |
| **19th Century** | **Karl Marx** | Emphasized manufacturing as a source of wealth but focused on the exploitation of labor within capitalist systems. | *Das Kapital* (1867) | Critiqued how manufacturing creates wealth but saw it as a tool of exploitation under capitalism. |
| **19th Century** | **David Ricardo** | Suggested that manufacturing, through comparative advantage, could drive wealth creation in global trade. | *Principles of Political Economy* (1817) | Manufacturing, by focusing on comparative advantage, was key to national and global wealth generation. |
| **19th Century** | **John Stuart Mill** | Argued for the importance of both agriculture and manufacturing but saw industrial growth as essential for progress. | *Principles of Political Economy* (1848) | Saw manufacturing as essential for societal progress, while balancing it with concerns for social welfare. |
| **20th Century** | **Joseph Schumpeter** | Introduced the concept of "creative destruction," where innovation in manufacturing leads to economic progress. | *Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy* (1942) | Saw innovation and manufacturing as driving forces of economic cycles, emphasizing their role in wealth and productivity. |
| **20th Century** | **Henry Ford** | Revolutionized manufacturing through the assembly line, emphasizing efficiency in production as a key to creating wealth. | N/A (Ford's production methods) | Manufacturing efficiency through the division of labor, mass production, and technological innovation as core wealth generators. |
| **Late 20th Century** | **Globalization Theorists** | Emphasized manufacturing in developing nations as a driver of wealth through global trade and outsourcing. | N/A | Manufacturing was seen as the engine of economic growth, especially for developing economies integrating into global markets. |
| **21st Century** | **Digital and Advanced Manufacturing Advocates** | Highlighted how manufacturing integrated with AI, robotics, and 3D printing can drive wealth creation in advanced economies. | N/A | Advanced manufacturing technologies are seen as the next phase of productivity and wealth creation in modern economies. |

### Classical Economics

> Classical & neoclassical economics isn’t science—it’s theology in a cheap math disguise.

> Unlike the natural sciences, classical economics begins not with observation, but with a priori assumptions about human behavior—rational agents, perfect markets, and invisible hands. From these arbitrary starting points, it builds intricate deductive models that are rarely, if ever, tested against real-world data.

> “Assume a principle governs behavior; create a model; deduce consequences”—this is the methodological core.

> Compare this with Newtonian science, which begins by observing phenomena, gathering empirical data, and formulating models that must be continuously validated, falsified, and refined. Classical economics does the opposite: it starts with dogma and ends with circular reasoning. Its predictions are often unfalsifiable or explained away post hoc when they fail.

> Classical economics confuses logical consistency with empirical truth. It’s not progress—it’s pretense.


> **Classical economics** is an economic theory that emphasizes the role of free markets, self-regulation, and the pursuit of individual self-interest as drivers of economic growth and efficiency.
> 

> Smith had a deep, intuitive understanding of emergence. Smith and others knew that aggregate patterns emerge from individual behavior and interactions. And individuals’ behavior responds to these aggregate patterns.
> 

> Smith’s “indivisible hand” metaphor for markets is popularly misinterpreted as a message that “greed is good” (something that Smith did not believe), but in reality was a statement about emergence - how individuals’ actions “without intending it, without knowing” lead to a collective outcome which feedback to influence further actions. Thus, a recursive, reflexive loop is at the heart of the economy.
> 

**Classical economics** refers to the dominant school of economic thought that prevailed from the late 18th century to the late 19th century. Key figures associated with classical economics include Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and John Stuart Mill.

#### Key Results of Classical Economics

| **Result**                                    | **Description**                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Labor Theory of Value**                     | The value of a good is determined by the amount of socially necessary labor time required to produce it.              |
| **Distribution of Income**                    | Income is divided among wages (labor), profits (capital), and rent (land), based on production factors.               |
| **Say’s Law (Supply Creates Its Own Demand)** | Production of goods generates enough income to purchase those goods, implying no general overproduction.              |
| **Natural Rate of Wages and Interest**        | Wages and interest rates tend toward “natural” levels determined by productivity and population growth.               |
| **Diminishing Returns**                       | Adding more units of one factor (e.g., labor) to fixed other factors (e.g., land) eventually reduces marginal output. |
| **Capital Accumulation and Growth**           | Savings are invested, leading to capital accumulation which drives economic growth over time.                         |
| **Market Self-Regulation**                    | Competitive markets tend toward equilibrium where supply equals demand without need for intervention.                 |
| **Profit Rate Equalization**                  | Competition tends to equalize profit rates across industries by capital movement.                                     |
| **Value as Cost of Production**               | Prices tend toward cost of production, primarily labor costs, with market fluctuations around this.                   |
| **Wage Fund Doctrine**                        | A fixed “fund” of capital is available for paying wages, limiting wage growth in the short term.                      |

### Neoclassical Economics

> The  **"Neo-Classical Economics"** term **Thorstein Veblen** in his 1900 article **"Preconceptions of Economic Science"** - to "mean" **not a revitalized version of classical economics**; but as **a replacement of the old dominant economic paradigm** / called classical economics.

| **Modeling Use**        | Underpins demand theory, market behavior models, game theory, and welfare analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Critiques**           | - Unrealistic simplification of human behavior.<br>- Ignores social, emotional, and cultural factors.<br>- Overlooks bounded rationality and heuristics.<br>- Does not capture altruism or cooperation well.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Alternatives**        | Behavioral economics models with bounded rationality, social preferences, heuristics; ecological or institutional economics emphasizing context and networks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

#### 📈 Key Results of Neoclassical Economics

| **Result**                                           | **Description**                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Equilibrium Price Formation**                      | Prices adjust so that supply equals demand in perfectly competitive markets.                                          |
| **Marginal Utility Theory**                          | Consumers allocate income to maximize utility, where goods’ values are derived from their marginal utility.           |
| **Marginal Productivity Theory**                     | Factors of production (labor, capital) are paid according to their marginal contributions to output.                  |
| **Pareto Efficiency**                                | Competitive equilibria are Pareto optimal, meaning no one can be made better off without making someone worse off.    |
| **General Equilibrium Theory**                       | Simultaneous equilibrium in all markets exists under certain assumptions (Arrow-Debreu model).                        |
| **Consumer and Producer Surplus**                    | Measures of welfare gains from market transactions and resource allocation efficiency.                                |
| **Optimal Resource Allocation**                      | Markets allocate resources efficiently when no externalities or public goods distort incentives.                      |
| **Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns**              | Adding more of a factor yields decreasing incremental output, influencing production functions and cost curves.       |
| **Rational Expectations**                            | Agents’ expectations are model-consistent, leading to equilibria based on anticipations of future policies or states. |
| **Income Distribution Determined by Factor Markets** | Factor payments arise from marginal productivity, shaping wages and returns to capital.                               |
