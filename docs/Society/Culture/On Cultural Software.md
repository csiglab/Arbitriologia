# On Cultural Software

I’m surprised how many people don’t get that genes =/= memes. Kinda like hardware =/= software. A population can change their memes (language, religion, mythology) several times and still remain genetically the same. Like if you change OS on yr laptop, it’s still the same laptop

Also we tend to exaggerate how deeply and rapidly the memes change. For example a “change of religion” would typically be a much more superficial phenomenon than one could assume reading the narrative sources (especially written by clergy)
