# Bushido

> Bushidō (武士道, “Way of the Warrior”) is the ethical, philosophical, and cultural code of the samurai class in Japan. It blends martial discipline, Confucian ethics, Zen Buddhist thought, and Shintō loyalty into a system of personal and social conduct.

> Samurai followed their masters — and at times their own interests — rather than some abstract written code. Most could not have read such codifications anyway, and they were not widely disseminated.

## Structure

> How is Bushidō structured as a system of social and personal normative principles?

| **Part**                     | **Role**                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ethical Virtues (*Gi, Yū, Chūgi, Meiyo*) | Provide internal moral guidance; shape personal character and decision-making.                       |
| Social Obligations                       | Define duties toward lord, peers, and subordinates; maintain hierarchical and communal order.        |
| Practical Conduct                        | Translate ethical and social norms into action; cultivate martial skill, discipline, and competence. |
| Ritual & Symbolic Practices              | Reinforce norms and social cohesion through ceremonies, aesthetics, and symbolic behaviors.          |
| Contextual Flexibility                   | Allow adaptation of principles to circumstances, balancing moral ideals with real-world demands.     |

## Practice

> In the **practical-historical sense**, *Bushidō* was not a fixed or universally followed code. It was **class-specific**, applying primarily to the samurai, and its **systematic codification** emerged mainly during the **Tokugawa period (1600–1868)**, when long peace required a moral framework to define the samurai’s role beyond warfare. Earlier warrior practices were **customary, situational, and pragmatic**, rather than formalized doctrines, and much of what is now called *Bushidō* was **retrospectively constructed** by writers such as Yamaga Sokō, Daidōji Yūzan, and Nitobe Inazō, rather than widely lived by samurai. In modern times, *Bushidō* has been **symbolically reinterpreted**, often idealized or mythologized, diverging from historical reality. **Thus, it is better understood as an evolving cultural discourse on the samurai ethos, rather than a timeless warrior code.**

## Relation

| System                              | Relation with Bushidō                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Confucianism                        | Emphasizes loyalty, filial piety, and ethical behavior, which influenced Bushidō’s moral and social principles.                             |
| Zen Buddhism                        | Introduced mindfulness, meditation, and acceptance of impermanence, shaping the samurai’s approach to life, death, and discipline.          |
| Shinto                              | Instilled reverence for ancestors, loyalty to one’s lord, and ritual purity, reinforcing Bushidō’s spiritual and ethical foundations.       |
| Feudal Japanese legal codes         | Provided the structural and social context in which Bushidō norms were practiced, linking duties to hierarchical obligations.               |
| European chivalry                   | Though culturally distinct, it shares ideals of honor, courage, loyalty, and martial ethics, making it a comparative reference for Bushidō. |
| Legalist elements (Tokugawa period) | Emphasized obedience and codified rules that influenced the formalization of samurai conduct under Bushidō.                                 |
