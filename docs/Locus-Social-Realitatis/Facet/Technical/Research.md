> The Knowledge Production System is a compound interaction-regulation system composed of recursive interaction units and layered mechanisms of validation, reproduction, and symbolic control over truth claims. It is deeply embedded in and co-evolves with its environment (culture, economy, polity).

## Terminology


> Innovation as a way of adaption.

>  The “National Innovation System” is not a system in the strict systems-theoretic sense, but a territorially anchored analytical construct used to study the institutional and organizational conditions shaping innovation within a nation-state.

> **National Innovation Systems (NIS)** are the networks of institutions, organizations, and individuals that interact and collaborate to produce and diffuse new knowledge, technologies, and products within a specific country or region.
> 

> **NIS** can be strengthened and made more effective through the development of supportive policies and institutions that encourage collaboration, knowledge sharing, and investment in research and development.
>

> Effective innovation systems require a balance between competition and cooperation, as well as a mix of public and private investments in research and development.
> 

> Different countries have different strengths and weaknesses in their innovation systems, and it is important to understand the unique characteristics of each system in order to promote successful innovation policies and practices.
> 

> NIS can reduce companies’ cost if a shared research program attaches the everyday problems of the industry - collaboration - and make money indifferentism ej (services, business model, customer support, etc.) …
> 

> The **NIS** includes formal and informal components, such as universities, research institutes, government agencies, private sector companies, venture capitalists, and innovation networks. These components interact and collaborate in various ways, such as through research partnerships, technology transfer agreements, and funding mechanisms.
> 

> A **NIS** aims to facilitate the flow of knowledge, resources, and ideas across different sectors and stakeholders to support innovation and economic growth. By promoting collaboration and coordination among various actors, an NIS can create a favorable environment for innovation and ensure that new technologies are effectively diffused and commercialized. Many countries worldwide have implemented policies and strategies to strengthen their national innovation systems and enhance their competitiveness in the global economy.

Research and Development (R&D) funding models vary based on the nature of the projects, the industry, and the organizations' goals. Here is a list of standard R&D funding models:

1. **Government Grants and Funding:** Obtaining financial support from government agencies through grants, subsidies, and research contracts. This includes funding from national research foundations and governmental bodies dedicated to scientific and technological advancement.
2. **Private Sector Investment:** Attracting investments from private companies, venture capitalists, or corporate investors interested in supporting R&D initiatives. This can involve equity investments, partnerships, or strategic collaborations.
3. **Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs):** Collaborative ventures between public institutions (universities or research organizations) and private companies. PPPs leverage both sectors' resources, expertise, and funding to advance R&D projects.
4. **Industry Consortia:** Forming alliances with multiple companies within the same industry to pool resources and fund joint R&D projects. Consortia are particularly common in sectors that require collaborative efforts.
5. **Venture Capital Funding:** Raising capital from venture capital firms that fund early-stage and high-growth potential technology and innovation projects. Startups and innovative ventures often seek venture capital financing.
6. **Angel Investors:** Individual investors, often with a background in the industry, who fund R&D projects. Angel investors may contribute their expertise and mentorship in addition to financial support.
7. **Research Foundations and Nonprofits:** Receiving funding from research-focused foundations and nonprofit organizations dedicated to advancing knowledge and addressing specific challenges. These entities may fund academic and applied research.
8. **Crowdfunding:** Raising funds from many individuals through online crowdfunding platforms. This model is prevalent for smaller projects or those with broad public appeal.
9. **Technology Incubators and Accelerators:** Joining technology incubators or accelerators that provide funding, mentorship, and resources to startups and innovative projects. These programs often culminate in a demo day where startups pitch to potential investors.
10. **Corporate Innovation Programs:** Large corporations may allocate internal funds for innovation and R&D activities. This can include dedicated budgets for research labs, innovation centers, and intrapreneurship programs.
11. **Strategic Alliances and Licensing:** Forming strategic alliances with other companies or licensing intellectual property to generate revenue for R&D. This model involves sharing technology, expertise, and risks.
12. **Collaboration with Academic Institutions:** Partnering with universities and research institutions to access their resources, expertise, and funding opportunities. This can involve joint research projects, grants, and industry-academic collaborations.
13. **Tax Incentives and Credits:** Governments may offer tax incentives, credits, or deductions to encourage companies to invest in R&D. This can reduce the overall cost of R&D activities.
14. **Innovation Competitions and Prizes:** Participating in innovation competitions or applying for prizes from industry associations, governments, or private organizations. Winning or placing in these competitions can provide funding and recognition.
15. **Philanthropic Contributions:** Receiving contributions from charitable organizations and individuals interested in supporting research and innovation for social or environmental purposes.
16. Development Bank
17. Pioneer Bank (Bank that Invests in New Industries)
18. [China Government Guidance Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Government_Guidance_Fund)
    1. [Understanding Chinese Government Guidance Funds](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/understanding-chinese-government-guidance-funds/)
19. **Innovation Vouchers**: Providing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) vouchers to access research and innovation services.
20. …

Organizations often use a combination of these funding models to secure the resources needed for their R&D initiatives. The choice of a particular model depends on factors such as the nature of the research, the industry, and the organization's strategic goals.

**Tax Credit:** “Tax credit” refers to an amount of money that taxpayers can subtract directly from the taxes they owe. This is different from tax deductions, which lower the amount of an individual’s taxable income.
