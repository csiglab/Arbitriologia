## Economic Analysis

> Let say  we have  **product**, **resource** “something with value (subjective)”, service **x**;   by the **economics** of **x;** we mean a **characterization of the systems** that allows x to go from **H** owner to **W** wanted? Productive Knowledge, Supply, Demand, Market Structure, Risk, Return, Regulations, Elasticity, Externalities, Market Failures, Infra-structure (Energy, Transportation, …)
> 

> The economics of **x;**   can also mean how affect affect **economic processes** like economic decision making , etc.
> 

| **Level of Analysis** | **Focus** | **What it Examines** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Micro Level** | Behavior and decisions of individuals or firms | How households and firms decide what to produce, consume, and invest in; interactions that determine market outcomes such as prices and quantities. |
| **Meso Level** | Behavior and decisions of groups (industries or regional economies) | Competition among firms in a particular industry; effects of economic policies on the performance of specific regions. |
| **Macro Level** | Overall performance of the economy | Trends in key economic indicators such as GDP, inflation, and unemployment; factors driving these trends; role of government policies in shaping the economy. |

## Economic Modelling

> **Modelling Tools**: Economic Phenomena → Model.
> 

> Economic models are ‘effective theories’;  they don’t  model  how exactly  model the underlying system exactly; see the **as if principle**.
> 

> An **economic model** is a theoretical construct designed to analyze the behavior of economic agents using quantitative and logical methods.
> 

> A model can be **formulated** **verbally and/or in the form of equations and/or diagrams** and is composed of a list of variables that characterize the economic agents and the economic environment under considerations, and a list of assumptions about constraints and choices.
> 

> An economic model is always a **simplified representation of the real world**, and the choice of the degree of simplifmicroications is dictated by the focus of the research and the aviability of relevant information.
> 

> To understand the economy of a moment is to deeply understand the productive forefront of that moment. - Roberto Unger.
> 

> **Dynamics**: Dynamics in economics refer to the evolving and interactive processes by which economic variables, such as prices, outputs, and employment, change over time in response to various factors, shaping the overall behavior of an economic system.
> 

> **Holism**: Holism in an economic system embodies the perspective that the entire economic structure is an integrated and interconnected entity, emphasizing the importance of studying the system as a whole rather than focusing solely on individual components.
> 

> The e**ndogeneity principl**e in economics posits that certain variables or factors within an economic model are determined by the system itself, considering internal interactions and feedback loops, rather than being externally imposed.
> 

> **Exogeneity principle** in economics asserts that certain variables or factors are treated as external and unaffected by the economic system under consideration, often used to distinguish between endogenous variables influenced by the model and exogenous variables considered as given inputs.
> 

> **Synergy** is an interaction or cooperation giving rise to a whole greater than the simple sum of its parts. The term synergy comes from the Attic Greek word συνεργία synergia from synergos, συνεργός, meaning “working together”. https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Synergy; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9131462/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9125226/
> 

> **Feedback**:  Economic feedback refers to the dynamic and interactive process in which changes in one economic variable or factor lead to subsequent effects that may either reinforce (positive feedback) or counteract (negative feedback) the initial change, creating a cyclical or self-reinforcing pattern within an economic system. Feedback mechanisms play a crucial role in shaping the behavioreconoic and stability of economic processes, influencing factors such as production, consumption, investment, and overall economic performance.
> 

> **Coevolution**: **Coevolution** as a modeling principle simultaneously simulates the dynamic reciprocal interactions and adaptations between multiple entities or variables, capturing the mutual influence that shapes their evolving behaviors or characteristics.

### The Economy: An Embedded System

> The concept of the economy as an "embedding system" refers to the idea that the economy is deeply integrated within and influenced by its broader social, cultural, and environmental contexts.
> 

> An embedding system conceptualizes the economy as an entity that operates within and is shaped by various external factors, including social norms, cultural practices, and environmental conditions. It emphasizes that economic activities are not isolated but are embedded in and interact with a wider system of social and ecological components.

## Economic Thought

> **Ideas** as the main drivers of economic policy; in the approach of “development“  there  is usually a “conceptual“ error (e.g lack of awareness of the nature and importance of technological and research infra-structure) that understand development  in **neo-classical** terms, not as structural transformation,  and evolutionary modes.
> 

> Praxis ← →  Theory: Look at the practices;  theories and interactions.
> 

> Here is a table tracing the **history of manufacturing as the source of wealth** through various economic and philosophical perspectives:
> 
- How are ideas acquired?
- Which models of diffusion of ideas we have?
- Can we infer when established ideas will show up in a society?

| **Period** | **Thinker/School** | **Contribution/Key Idea** | **Key Work** | **Impact on the Concept of Manufacturing as Wealth** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Ancient Times** | **Plato** | Valued agriculture and handicrafts but saw commerce as secondary to virtue. | *Republic* | Manufacturing seen as necessary but not central to societal wealth. |
| **Ancient Times** | **Aristotle** | Distinguished between natural wealth (necessary goods) and artificial wealth (commerce, money). | *Politics* | Focused more on the ethical implications of wealth rather than on manufacturing as a source of wealth. |
| **Late Medieval** | **Scholasticism** | Emphasized just pricing in commerce, less focus on manufacturing. | N/A | Manufacturing's role in wealth generation was modest, overshadowed by ethical debates on trade. |
| **16th Century** | **Antonio Serra** | Argued for a favorable balance of trade based on manufacturing over raw materials. | *Breve trattato delle cause* (1613) | First to argue that manufacturing, especially in urban areas, could generate greater wealth than agriculture. |
| **17th Century** | **Mercantilists (e.g., Colbert)** | Advocated that national wealth is generated by maximizing exports of manufactured goods and limiting imports. | N/A (Colbert's policies in France) | Strongly pushed for state-controlled manufacturing, seeing it as a path to national prosperity. |
| **18th Century** | **William Petty** | Promoted the idea that manufacturing and labor contributed to the wealth of nations. | *Political Arithmetick* (1690) | Quantified the contributions of manufacturing to national wealth, a precursor to modern economic thought. |
| **18th Century** | **François Quesnay (Physiocrats)** | Saw agriculture as the only true source of wealth, downplaying the role of manufacturing. | *Tableau économique* (1758) | Rejected the centrality of manufacturing in favor of agriculture, contrasting with mercantilist thought. |
| **18th Century** | **Adam Smith** | Argued that division of labor in manufacturing leads to greater productivity and thus wealth. | *The Wealth of Nations* (1776) | Rejected mercantilism, stating that manufacturing and labor (through specialization) create wealth more than trade balances. |
| **19th Century** | **Karl Marx** | Emphasized manufacturing as a source of wealth but focused on the exploitation of labor within capitalist systems. | *Das Kapital* (1867) | Critiqued how manufacturing creates wealth but saw it as a tool of exploitation under capitalism. |
| **19th Century** | **David Ricardo** | Suggested that manufacturing, through comparative advantage, could drive wealth creation in global trade. | *Principles of Political Economy* (1817) | Manufacturing, by focusing on comparative advantage, was key to national and global wealth generation. |
| **19th Century** | **John Stuart Mill** | Argued for the importance of both agriculture and manufacturing but saw industrial growth as essential for progress. | *Principles of Political Economy* (1848) | Saw manufacturing as essential for societal progress, while balancing it with concerns for social welfare. |
| **20th Century** | **Joseph Schumpeter** | Introduced the concept of "creative destruction," where innovation in manufacturing leads to economic progress. | *Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy* (1942) | Saw innovation and manufacturing as driving forces of economic cycles, emphasizing their role in wealth and productivity. |
| **20th Century** | **Henry Ford** | Revolutionized manufacturing through the assembly line, emphasizing efficiency in production as a key to creating wealth. | N/A (Ford's production methods) | Manufacturing efficiency through the division of labor, mass production, and technological innovation as core wealth generators. |
| **Late 20th Century** | **Globalization Theorists** | Emphasized manufacturing in developing nations as a driver of wealth through global trade and outsourcing. | N/A | Manufacturing was seen as the engine of economic growth, especially for developing economies integrating into global markets. |
| **21st Century** | **Digital and Advanced Manufacturing Advocates** | Highlighted how manufacturing integrated with AI, robotics, and 3D printing can drive wealth creation in advanced economies. | N/A | Advanced manufacturing technologies are seen as the next phase of productivity and wealth creation in modern economies. |

## German School Economics

> The **German School** emphasized the importance of empirical research in economics, including using historical data and case studies. They believed that economic theory should be grounded in empirical observation and that abstract reasoning should be avoided.
> 

> The German Historical School of Economics, rooted in the 19th-century, emphasized the importance of historical, cultural, and institutional factors in understanding economic phenomena, advocating for a context-specific and interdisciplinary approach to economic analysis.
> 

> The German School believed that the state had a role to play in shaping economic outcomes, mainly through providing public goods and regulating economic activity. They argued that the state was responsible for promoting economic development and social welfare and that laissez-faire policies were inadequate to achieve these goals.
> 

> The German School focused on economic institutions, such as legal systems, property rights, and social customs, as critical factors in shaping economic outcomes. They believed that institutions played a crucial role in determining economic behavior and outcomes and that economic analysis should focus on the interactions between institutions and economic actors.

## Theoretical Economics

## Keynesian Economics

> **Keynesian economics** is a **macroeconomic theory** advocating for government intervention, particularly through fiscal policy, to manage aggregate demand and stabilize the economy, with a focus on achieving full employment and economic growth.
> 

Several fundamental principles and policy tools characterize the Keynesian framework of economic policy:

1. **Aggregate Demand Management**: Keynesian economics emphasizes managing aggregate demand to achieve full employment and stable economic growth. Policies focus on stimulating demand during economic downturns and cooling down demand during periods of inflation or overheating.
2. **Fiscal Policy**: Keynesian policy advocates for active fiscal policy, where the government adjusts its spending and taxation levels to stabilize the economy. During recessions, governments increase spending or reduce taxes to boost demand and create jobs, while during periods of inflation, they may decrease spending or raise taxes to restrain demand.
3. **Counter-Cyclical Policies**: Keynesian economics emphasizes using counter-cyclical policies to offset fluctuations in the business cycle. Governments intervene to smooth out economic fluctuations by adopting expansionary policies during recessions and contractionary policies during booms.
4. **Public Investment**: Keynesian policy supports public investment in infrastructure, education, healthcare, and other sectors to stimulate economic activity and promote long-term growth. Public investment creates jobs, boosts demand in the short term, and enhances productivity and capacity in the long term.
5. **Monetary Policy Coordination**: While fiscal policy is central to the Keynesian framework, it also recognizes the role of monetary policy in managing the economy. Keynesian economists advocate for coordination between fiscal and monetary authorities to achieve macroeconomic stability and promote full employment.
6. **Role of Government**: Keynesian economics assigns an active role to government in stabilizing the economy and addressing market failures. Governments intervene to correct deficiencies in aggregate demand, provide public goods, regulate markets, and ensure social welfare.
7. **Income Distribution**: Keynesian policy considers income distribution and social welfare as essential objectives. Policies aim to reduce income inequality, alleviate poverty, and ensure equitable access to opportunities through progressive taxation, social safety nets, and targeted spending programs.

## Economic Complexity

> How an economic system evolves to generate an economy with the same levels of (R&D, Value Added, Productivity, ECI, and Patent) of front-runners. We assume here that a product is a solution to a particular problem.
> 

> **Economic complexity** as they can be used for the analysis of places, firms, products, occupations, technologies, scientific research and educational areas, as well as the interactions among them and their evolution over time. The world is incredibly complex but understanding requires simplification through tractable models that have fewer dimensions.
> 

> Much of economics has relied on aggregation as a dimensionality reduction mechanism, summing up the economic components of the world into fewer categories such as GDP, capital and labor. However, aggregation erases information regarding the structure of the economy.
> 

> **Economic complexity** tools try to minimize this information loss while preserving tractability. The idea is that activities require capabilities that are distributed across individuals and organizations and must be brought together for each activity to happen.
>

Here is a table summarizing the main theorists of **Mercantilism**, their key contributions, and their influence on the development of political economy:

| **Theorist** | **Main Contributions** | **Key Works** | **Influence on Political Economy** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Jean-Baptiste Colbert** | Prominent French statesman; developed policies promoting state control over the economy to enhance national wealth. | **"Colbertisme" (policy, not written works)** | Advocated protectionist trade policies, state-sponsored industries, and colonial expansion to increase France's wealth. |
| **Thomas Mun** | Argued that a nation's wealth was measured by its stock of gold and silver, and that trade surpluses should be achieved through exports. | **"England’s Treasure by Forraign Trade" (1664)** | Influenced British mercantilism by emphasizing the importance of trade surpluses and the role of the state in economic policy. |
| **Gerard de Malynes** | Focused on the role of the exchange of goods, the value of money, and the balance of trade in national wealth. | **"Lex Mercatoria" (1622)** | One of the first to argue for strong government control over the economy, particularly in monetary policy and foreign trade. |
| **Antonio Serra** | Differentiated between wealth derived from productive sectors like manufacturing and mining. | **"Brief Treatise on the Causes of the Rise of the Prices of Goods in Spain" (1613)** | His work laid the foundation for distinguishing between productive and unproductive economic activities. |
| **Philippe de La Court** | Criticized excessive state intervention and argued for some forms of free trade while still aligning with mercantilist thought. | **"The Interest of Holland" (1662)** | Early critic of overregulation but still saw value in state-sponsored trade to accumulate wealth for the nation. |
| **William Petty** | Combined mercantilist views with a focus on political arithmetic (quantitative measurement of wealth and power). | **"Political Arithmetick" (1690)** | His use of statistical methods influenced early economic thought, contributing to the quantitative side of political economy. |
| **Charles Davenant** | Emphasized the importance of regulating the economy through tariffs, navigation laws, and colonial exploitation. | **"Discourses on the Public Revenues, and on the Trade of England" (1698)** | Contributed to policy debates on taxation, trade regulation, and the protection of British colonial interests. |
| **Josiah Child** | Promoted the role of the East India Company in driving British trade dominance and emphasized export over import. | **"A New Discourse of Trade" (1693)** | Influenced English mercantilist thought by showing how monopolies and trade companies could support national economic growth. |
| **Bernard Mandeville** | Argued paradoxically that private vices (like luxury) could lead to public benefits (such as economic growth). | **"The Fable of the Bees" (1714)** | His controversial ideas suggested that self-interest could inadvertently benefit the economy, prefiguring later economic liberalism. |
| **David Hume** | Critiqued mercantilism’s assumptions about money and wealth, emphasizing that inflows of gold could lead to inflation. | **"Political Discourses" (1752)** | Helped lay the groundwork for the classical liberal critique of mercantilism, arguing that wealth was not simply gold but productive capacity. |

## Classical Economics

> **Classical economics** is an economic theory that emphasizes the role of free markets, self-regulation, and the pursuit of individual self-interest as drivers of economic growth and efficiency.
> 

> Smith had a deep, intuitive understanding of emergence. Smith and others knew that aggregate patterns emerge from individual behavior and interactions. And individuals’ behavior responds to these aggregate patterns.
> 

> Smith’s “indivisible hand” metaphor for markets is popularly misinterpreted as a message that “greed is good” (something that Smith did not believe), but in reality was a statement about emergence - how individuals’ actions “without intending it, without knowing” lead to a collective outcome which feedback to influence further actions. Thus, a recursive, reflexive loop is at the heart of the economy.
> 

**Classical economics** refers to the dominant school of economic thought that prevailed from the late 18th century to the late 19th century. Key figures associated with classical economics include Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and John Stuart Mill.

Here are some of the main ideas associated with classical economics:

1. **Invisible Hand:** Adam Smith, often regarded as the father of classical economics, introduced the concept of the "invisible hand" in his work "The Wealth of Nations" (1776). This metaphorical idea suggests that individuals pursuing their self-interest unintentionally contribute to the overall economic well-being of society.
2. **Laissez-Faire:** Classical economists advocated for a laissez-faire approach to economic policy. They believed that markets if left to operate freely without government intervention, would naturally achieve the most efficient allocation of resources.
3. **Supply and Demand:** Classical economics emphasizes the role of supply and demand in determining prices and quantities of goods and services. The interaction of supply and demand in a competitive market is seen as the mechanism that leads to equilibrium prices.
4. **Labor Theory of Value:** Classical economists, especially David Ricardo and Adam Smith, adhered to the labor theory of value. This theory suggests that the value of a good is determined by the amount of labor required to produce it.
5. **Comparative Advantage:** David Ricardo introduced the concept of comparative advantage in his work "On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation" (1817). This idea argues that even if a country is less efficient than another in producing all goods, it can still benefit from specializing in producing the goods in which it has a comparative advantage.
6. **Say's Law:** Jean-Baptiste Say formulated Say's Law, which posits that "supply creates its own demand." In other words, the act of producing goods and services generates income, and this income, in turn, creates demand for other goods and services.
7. **Rational Economic Agents:** Classical economists assumed that individuals act rationally in their economic pursuits to maximize their utility or well-being. This assumption forms the basis for many classical economic models.
8. **Classical Dichotomy:** Classical economics often employed the classical dichotomy, which separates actual variables (such as quantities of goods and services) from nominal variables (such as money). Classical economists believed that changes in the money supply would primarily affect prices and nominal variables, not actual economic output.
9. **Wages and Profits:** Classical economists, including David Ricardo and Adam Smith, explored the determinants of wages and profits. They analyzed the role of competition, productivity, and the dynamics of labor and capital in shaping income distribution.
10. **Limited Government Intervention:** Classical economists generally advocated for minimal government interference in the economy. They argued that markets if left to operate freely, would lead to optimal outcomes without extensive government regulation or planning.

## Development Economics

> Theory and models of economic change (just description not practice).
> 

### List of Models

> …
> 

| Model | Description | Key Drivers | Developed By | Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Harrod-Domar Model | Suggests that savings and investment drive economic growth. A higher level of savings leads to higher investment, resulting in economic development. | Savings and Investment | Roy F. Harrod, Evsey Domar | 1930s-1940s |
| Solow-Swan Model | Proposes that technological progress drives economic growth. Technological advancements increase productivity and economic development. | Technological Progress | Robert Solow, Trevor Swan | 1950s-1960s |
| Lewis Model | Argues that economic growth is driven by a shift of labor from the agricultural sector to the industrial sector. Surplus labor in agriculture fuels the growth of the industrial sector, leading to economic development. | Labor Shift (Agriculture to Industry) | Arthur Lewis | 1950s |
| Rostow’s Stages of Growth | Suggests that economic development occurs in five stages: traditional society, preconditions for takeoff, takeoff, drive to maturity, and high mass consumption. Countries must undergo these stages to achieve economic development. | Sequential Stages of Development | Walt Rostow | 1960s |
| Endogenous Growth Theory | Proposes that economic growth is driven by factors within the economy, such as research and development, education, and technological progress. Government policies can influence these factors, leading to economic growth. | Internal Factors (R&D, Education) | Paul Romer | 1980s |
| Economic Complexity Theory | It suggests that society develops by learning how to make new products and services. The current set of services and products can predict the new products and services that society will learn. | Learning and Innovation | Various Economists | Various Periods |

### Rich Economies vs. Developed Economy

> Not every growth is equal - we are structurally (generative) rich or just temporally (extracted)
> 

Here’s a comparison between "Rich Economies" and "Developed Economies":

| Aspect | Rich Economies | Developed Economies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Definition** | Economies with high levels of wealth and income per capita, often measured by GDP per capita. | Economies that have advanced technological infrastructure, high standards of living, and diversified industries. |
| **Wealth Indicator** | Primarily based on wealth and income levels. | Broader criteria including technological advancement, quality of life, and economic stability. |
| **Examples** | Countries like Qatar | Countries like the USA, Germany, and Japan. |
| **Economic Diversity** | May rely on specific sectors such as oil or finance. | Diverse economies with industrial solid, service, and technological sectors. |
| **Standard of Living** | High standard of living due to high income. | High standard of living with advanced healthcare, education, and infrastructure. |
| **Technological Adoption** | Varies; may not always be at the forefront of technology. | Leading in technological innovation and adoption. |
| **Sustainability** | Wealth does not always imply sustainable development. | Emphasis on sustainable development and environmental standards. |

### Latin America vs East Asia

> **Schumpeterian Dynamics**:  **Schumpeterian Dynamics** refers to the process of economic evolution driven by innovation, entrepreneurship, creative destruction, and the continual renewal of industries and economies.
> 

> …
> 

| **Dimensions** | **East Asian (Good)** | **Latin American (Bad)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Protections** Time Frame | Temporary | Permanent |
| **Markets** | World | Tiny Local Market |
| **Learning Curve** | Steep | Lags |
| **Dynamics** | Schumpeterian | Static (Planned Economy) |
| **Domestic Competition** | Great | Little |
| **Core Technology** | Controller | Imported (Superficial Industrialization) |
| **Education** | Planned for Industry | Did does not match industry (Feed immigration) |
| **Selection System** | Meritocracy | Nepotism |

### Structural Transformation

> **Structural transformation** in a society refers to a fundamental and enduring shift in the composition and organization of its economic, social, and political systems. This transformation typically involves significant changes in various aspects of the society, often leading to a reconfiguration of its core structures, institutions, and dynamics. Structural transformation can occur for various reasons, including technological advancements, economic development, demographic shifts, or changes in political ideologies.

### Reflection on Development

> "**Societal development** is akin to the organic growth and adaptation seen in biological organisms, where the evolution of structures, systems, and interactions over time fosters resilience, complexity, and sustainable progress.”

## **Institutional Economics**

> Institutional economics focuses on the role of institutions—rules, norms, and legal systems—in shaping economic behavior and outcomes. It contrasts with traditional economics, which often assumes perfectly competitive markets with fully informed agents.
> 

| **Framework/Model** | **Description** | **Key Predictions** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Transaction Cost Economics (TCE)** | Developed by **Oliver Williamson**, focuses on the costs associated with economic exchanges, especially when transaction partners have incomplete information. | - Organizations are formed to minimize transaction costs. <br> - Firms and markets are alternatives depending on efficiency in reducing transaction costs. |
| **New Institutional Economics (NIE)** | Focuses on the role of institutions in shaping economic behavior, incorporating transaction costs, property rights, and governance structures. | - Institutions (formal and informal) determine economic performance. <br> - Economic growth depends on the development of efficient institutions. |
| **Property Rights Theory** | Explores how the allocation and enforcement of property rights affect economic behavior and resource allocation. | - Clear and secure property rights lead to efficient resource allocation. <br> - Ambiguity in property rights can result in market failure or inefficient outcomes. |
| **Agency Theory** | Examines relationships where one party (the principal) delegates decision-making authority to another party (the agent), and how to align their interests. | - Incentive structures (e.g., contracts) can reduce agency problems. <br> - Information asymmetry leads to moral hazard and adverse selection. |
| **Douglass North's Theory of Institutional Change** | Focuses on how institutions evolve over time and their role in economic development, emphasizing path dependence. | - Institutional change is incremental and constrained by historical and cultural factors. <br> - Economic development is dependent on institutional stability and adaptation. |
| **The Institutional Matrix (Williamson)** | A framework analyzing the interactions between formal and informal institutions, and their effects on economic outcomes. | - The institutional matrix shapes the behavior of firms, markets, and governments. <br> - Changes in institutional rules impact transaction costs and incentives. |
| **Social Norms and Preferences (Bardhan)** | Examines how social norms and informal institutions influence economic decisions and the allocation of resources. | - Social norms can constrain or enhance economic behavior. <br> - Economic outcomes are often shaped by non-market institutions like norms, customs, and trust. |
| **Commons' Theory of Institutional Economics** | Focuses on how common-pool resources are managed and the role of collective action in preventing resource depletion. | - Collective action and governance mechanisms are essential for managing common-pool resources. <br> - Well-defined property rights and rules can prevent "tragedy of the commons." |
| **Law and Economics** | Analyzes how legal systems, rules, and contracts influence economic behavior, especially in areas like property rights, contracts, and dispute resolution. | - Efficient legal systems minimize transaction costs and promote economic activity. <br> - Property rights and contract enforcement are crucial for market efficiency. |
