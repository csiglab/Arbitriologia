# Export Deflation

: 16

"Exporting deflation" refers to a scenario where a country's economic policies or conditions lead to deflationary effects that extend beyond its borders, influencing other economies. This typically happens through international trade.

Here's how it works in more detail:

1. **Domestic Deflation**: The country experiences deflation, which is a general decrease in the price level of goods and services. This could be due to various factors like reduced demand, high unemployment, increased productivity without corresponding increase in consumption, or technological advances making production cheaper.
2. **Export Prices**: Because of deflation, the goods produced in the country become cheaper. When these goods are exported, they carry the lower price tags with them.
3. **Impact on Importing Countries**: Other countries that import these cheaper goods might see prices in their own markets decrease as these low-cost imports compete with domestic products. This can lead to deflationary pressures in the importing countries, particularly if the imports make up a significant portion of the market.
4. **Global Supply Chains**: In a globalized economy, the effects of deflation can be amplified through global supply chains. If a major manufacturing country is exporting deflation, it can affect prices and economic conditions in many countries that are linked through trade.

Countries with large export sectors, like China, can have significant deflationary impacts on the global economy, especially if they engage in competitive devaluation of their currency to boost exports further. This makes their goods even cheaper abroad, potentially exacerbating deflationary pressures in other countries.
