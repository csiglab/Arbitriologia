- How to sell energy to customers without operating the grid - infrastructure?
- What happens if an electricity supplier fails to supply enough electricity to meet its customers' demand, and how is this situation managed?
- …

Here’s a **table of types of enterprises in energy markets**, categorizing them based on their roles, functions, and activities in the energy value chain:

| **Type of Enterprise** | **Description** | **Key Activities** | **Examples** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Vertically Integrated Utilities** | Companies that own and operate the entire energy value chain (generation, transmission, distribution, and retail). | Generating electricity, managing grids, and selling to end customers. | Duke Energy, E.ON, PG&E. |
| **Independent Power Producers (IPPs)** | Companies that generate electricity but do not own transmission or distribution networks. | Building and operating power plants (renewable, fossil fuels, nuclear). | NextEra Energy, AES Corporation. |
| **Transmission System Operators (TSOs)** | Companies that manage the high-voltage transmission grid. | Ensuring electricity flows efficiently from generators to distribution networks. | National Grid (UK), REE (Spain), TenneT (Netherlands). |
| **Distribution System Operators (DSOs)** | Companies that manage the low-voltage distribution grid. | Delivering electricity to end customers (residential, commercial, industrial). | E-Distribución (Spain), EDP Distribuição (Portugal). |
| **Retail Electricity Providers** | Companies that sell electricity directly to end customers. | Offering tariffs, billing, and customer service. | Audax Renovables, Reliant Energy, Bulb Energy. |
| **Energy Traders** | Companies that buy and sell electricity in wholesale markets. | Trading electricity, managing price risks, and optimizing portfolios. | Vitol, Trafigura, Mercuria. |
| **Renewable Energy Developers** | Companies that develop and operate renewable energy projects (wind, solar, etc.). | Building and managing wind farms, solar parks, and hydroelectric plants. | SunPower, Vestas, Ørsted. |
| **Energy Service Companies (ESCOs)** | Companies that provide energy efficiency and management services. | Conducting energy audits, retrofits, and performance contracting. | Schneider Electric, Siemens Energy, Engie. |
| **Energy Storage Providers** | Companies that develop and operate energy storage systems (batteries, etc.). | Providing grid services, energy arbitrage, and backup power. | Tesla Energy, Fluence, LG Chem. |
| **Microgrid Operators** | Companies that operate localized grids that can function independently. | Managing microgrids for resilience, renewable integration, and off-grid solutions. | Schneider Electric, Siemens, ABB. |
| **Virtual Power Plant (VPP) Operators** | Companies that aggregate distributed energy resources to act as a single power plant. | Managing DERs for grid services, capacity markets, and energy trading. | Next Kraftwerke, Autogrid, Sunverge. |
| **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Energy Trading Platforms** | Companies that enable direct energy trading between consumers. | Facilitating P2P energy transactions using blockchain or other technologies. | Power Ledger, LO3 Energy. |
| **Community Choice Aggregators (CCAs)** | Local entities that aggregate electricity demand to purchase power on behalf of residents. | Procuring electricity, often with a focus on renewable energy. | Marin Clean Energy (USA), Sonoma Clean Power (USA). |
| **Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS) Providers** | Companies that provide energy solutions (generation, storage, efficiency) as a service. | Offering subscription-based energy services and performance-based contracts. | Engie, Veolia, Enel X. |
| **Oil and Gas Companies** | Companies involved in the exploration, production, and distribution of fossil fuels. | Extracting and refining oil and gas, and distributing to markets. | Shell, BP, ExxonMobil. |
| **Nuclear Energy Companies** | Companies that operate nuclear power plants. | Generating electricity from nuclear reactors. | EDF (France), Rosatom (Russia), Exelon (USA). |

## **Distribution System Operators (DSOs)**

> **Distribution System Operators (DSOs)** play a crucial role in delivering electricity from the transmission grid to end customers (residential, commercial, and industrial). While DSOs do not decide **which supplier** provides electricity to a customer, they ensure that the electricity is physically delivered to the correct location.
> 

Here’s how energy is allocated to customers by DSOs:

---

### **Role of DSOs**

- **Grid Management**: DSOs manage the low-voltage distribution grid, ensuring electricity flows safely and reliably to end users.
- **Neutral Role**: DSOs are neutral entities; they do not favor any specific energy supplier. Their job is to deliver electricity to customers regardless of the supplier.

---

### **2. How Energy is Allocated**

- **Supplier Contracts**: Customers sign contracts with their chosen electricity supplier (e.g., Audax Renovables, Iberdrola, etc.). The supplier is responsible for procuring electricity and billing the customer.
- **Grid Connection**: The DSO ensures that the customer’s location is connected to the distribution grid.
- **Metering**: The DSO installs and maintains meters to measure the customer’s electricity consumption.

---

### **3. Process of Energy Allocation**

1. **Electricity Injection**:
    - The electricity supplier (e.g., Audax) procures electricity from its own generation assets (e.g., wind farms) or the wholesale market.
    - The electricity is injected into the transmission grid, managed by the **Transmission System Operator (TSO)**.
2. **Transmission to Distribution Grid**:
    - The TSO transmits the electricity to the regional distribution grid managed by the DSO.
3. **Delivery to Customers**:
    - The DSO delivers the electricity to the customer’s location through the distribution grid.
    - The DSO does not differentiate between suppliers; it simply ensures that the electricity reaches the customer’s meter.
4. **Metering and Data Collection**:
    - The DSO collects consumption data from the customer’s meter.
    - This data is shared with the customer’s electricity supplier for billing purposes.
5. **Billing**:
    - The electricity supplier (e.g., Audax) uses the consumption data to bill the customer.
    - The bill includes:
        - **Energy Charges**: Cost of electricity consumed (set by the supplier).
        - **Grid Usage Fees**: Charges for using the transmission and distribution grid (set by the TSO and DSO).

---

### **Renewable Energy Allocation**

- **Physical Electricity**: The electricity delivered to customers is a mix of all electricity in the grid, regardless of its source.
- **Virtual Allocation**: Suppliers like Audax can allocate renewable energy to customers virtually using **Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs)** or **Guarantees of Origin (GOs)**. These certificates ensure that the customer’s electricity consumption is matched by renewable energy generation, even though the physical electricity mixes in the grid.

---

### **Balancing Supply and Demand**

- **Supplier Responsibility**: The electricity supplier is responsible for ensuring that the amount of electricity it procures matches its customers’ consumption.
- **DSO Role**: The DSO ensures the stability of the distribution grid and manages local supply-demand imbalances.
