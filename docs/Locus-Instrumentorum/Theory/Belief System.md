# Belief System

: 13

> **Belief System**: A **structured set** of propositions, models, and rules governing the assignment, maintenance, revision, and interrelation of beliefs within an agent or community, often under constraints of internal consistency, external evidence, and computational tractability.
> 

## Formalization

> Belief System (Second-Order Cybernetics Formalization).
> 

> Using **second-order cybernetics** (the study of observing systems that include themselves in the observation), a **belief system** can be formalized even more richly.
> 

> A belief system is a *self-referential regulatory structure* within an autonomous cognitive system, where beliefs are operationally generated, maintained, and modified through recursive processes involving the system’s own observations and self-modeling.
> 

> The belief system evolves as part of the system's *organizational closure* — it adapts through feedback not only from the environment but also from internal evaluations of prior beliefs, their coherence, and their efficacy in maintaining systemic viability.

Key technical elements from **second-order** cybernetics:

- **Autopoiesis**: The belief system sustains itself by producing and reproducing its own components (beliefs, validation mechanisms, models of coherence).
- **Operational Closure**: Belief modifications happen through internal operations, even though they are structurally coupled to the environment.
- **Observer-Dependence**: The belief system is not an objective mirror of the world, but a construction shaped by the system's history of interactions.
- **Circular Causality**: Beliefs about beliefs (meta-beliefs) influence the generation of new beliefs.

In notation:

If we let

- $B(t)$ = set of beliefs at time $t$,
- $O(t)$ = observations at time $t$,
- $U$ = the update operator (recursive and system-dependent),

then the belief system dynamics can be written as:

- $B(t+1) = U(B(t), O(t), \text{evaluation}(B(t)))$ where the evaluation is also a function of B(t)B(t) itself.
