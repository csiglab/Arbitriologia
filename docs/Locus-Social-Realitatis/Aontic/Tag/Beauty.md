# Beauty

> **Beauty** is not a substance, but a relational phenomenon—a quality perceived in the fittingness, harmony, or expressive depth of forms. It emerges at the intersection of form, perception, and affect, and operates as a semi-stable attractor in aesthetic, moral, and symbolic systems.

> **Beauty** functions as a reinforcement mechanism—it captures attention, evokes care, and motivates preservation or imitation. It also serves as a reminder of coherence, harmony, or meaningful form in both the natural and human-made world. In this way, beauty plays a cognitive and affective role, signaling order amid complexity and aligning perception with value.

> Note: While designing cities, beauty should play a major role—not as a superficial aesthetic, but as a guiding principle that enhances livability, coherence, and human well-being. A beautiful city invites care, fosters identity, and reinforces the social and spatial order that makes urban life meaningful.

> **Beauty** as the externalization of national greatness—its potential and aspirations—and as a reminder of collective purpose, dignity, and long-term vision. In this sense, beauty in public works, architecture, and landscapes becomes a symbolic expression of what a nation strives to become.
