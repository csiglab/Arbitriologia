## 🧬 3. **Factions (派閥, *Habatsu*) – Internal Power Centers**

The LDP is **not monolithic**. It functions through internal **factions**, each with its own:

* Leadership hierarchy
* Donor networks
* Talent pipelines
* Voting blocs

Factions compete over:

* Cabinet appointments
* Policy influence
* Party presidency

| Famous Factions (Past & Present) | Notables                           |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Seiwa Seisaku Kenkyūkai          | Shinzo Abe                         |
| Kōchikai                         | Fumio Kishida                      |
| Heisei Kenkyūkai                 | Formerly led by Nobutaka Machimura |

Factions are **quasi-institutional** and often more important than ideology in shaping careers.

## 🧠 4. **Policy Development and Bureaucratic Interface**

* The **Policy Research Council (PRC)** is extremely powerful. It:

  * Coordinates with **ministries**
  * Shapes policy **before** it reaches the cabinet
  * Allows **bureaucrats** and **MPs** to co-write bills
* LDP works **symbiotically** with Japan’s elite bureaucracy (especially METI, MOF, and MEXT)

## 🪄 5. **Candidate Recruitment and Electoral Machinery**

| Feature                                                                                  | Description |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 🧭 Centralized control over candidate selection, but factions also push their own people |             |
| 🧱 Strong networks in rural areas (koenkai: personal support groups)                     |             |
| 💰 Fundraising via corporations, industry groups, and factional ties                     |             |

The LDP’s strength comes not just from ideology but from **deep, informal institutional networks** in government, business, and rural constituencies.
