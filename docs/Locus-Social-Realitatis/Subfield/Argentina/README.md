# Argentina

> A captivating blend of vibrant tango rhythms, breathtaking landscapes stretching from the Andes to the Pampas, and a rich cultural heritage fueled by passion, resilience, and the pursuit of gastronomic delights.
>

> Without the inhabitants of a country becoming enlightened, or in other words, without education, we could advance nothing.
>

> The trade we have done until now has been limited to very little, buying in Cádiz as cheaply as possible and selling in America as expensive as possible. (…) these infatuated men do not deserve the name of merchants.

> So agriculture is a springboard, not a ceiling. The trick is to reinvest the rents into R&D, logistics, and downstream industries (bio-inputs, precision machinery, functional foods, renewable-energy-powered agri-chemicals) so that the next export dollar contains more domestic IP and capital goods and less imported content.

## 📜 Economic History

**Guiding Questions:**
*What were the key drivers of economic growth in each period?*
*What transitions occurred (agrarian → industrial → service-based)?*

| **Period**            | **Key Events and Developments** |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Pre-modern Era (to 1816) | Colonial economy based on mining (Potosi, though in modern Bolivia) and subsistence agriculture. The Río de la Plata region was a commercial hub. |
| Agro-Export Model (c. 1880-1930) | **Driver:** Massive expansion of agricultural exports (beef, grains) fueled by foreign investment (primarily British), immigration, and the "Conquest of the Desert." Argentina became one of the world's wealthiest nations. **Transition:** Early-stage light industry emerges to process agricultural goods and supply domestic consumption. |
| Import-Substitution Industrialization (ISI) (c. 1930-1975) | **Driver:** Collapse of global trade in the 1930s and populist policies (Peronism). State-led industrialization to replace manufactured imports. Development of a diversified industrial base (automobiles, machinery, chemicals). **Transition:** Shift from agrarian to industrial-agrarian economy. Urbanization accelerates. |
| The "Lost Decade" and Neoliberalism (c. 1976-2001) | **Drivers:** Military dictatorship (1976-83) begins financial liberalization. Hyperinflation in the 1980s. In the 1990s, the *Convertibilidad* plan pegs the peso to the USD, taming inflation but leading to overvaluation, deindustrialization, and a massive debt buildup. **Transition:** Reversion to primary sector dominance and a growing service sector, while industry contracts. |
| Post-Default and Kirchner Era (2002-2015) | **Driver:** The 2001 default and devaluation. High global commodity prices. Heterodox policies with re-nationalizations, export taxes, and subsidies. Initial rapid growth followed by stagflation, capital controls, and rising protectionism. |
| Macri & Return of Peronism (2015-Present) | **Drivers:** A brief, failed attempt at market liberalization (2015-2019) led to a new debt crisis. The return of Peronism (Alberto Fernández, 2019-2023) with heavy state intervention, followed by the radical libertarian presidency of Javier Milei (2023-), focusing on drastic fiscal adjustment and deregulation. **Transition:** Economy remains heavily service-based with a strong primary sector, while industrial capacity is stagnant. |

| 1990s | All Levels | Decentralization | The Federal Education Law transferred primary and secondary schools to provincial control, often with inadequate funding, leading to increased inequality. |
| 2000s-Present | Scientific | "Scientific Vacations" | Despite producing high-quality graduates, chronic underfunding, brain drain ("fuga de cerebros"), and political volatility have undermined the system's stability and its link to productive sectors. |

## 🏭 Industrial Policy History

**Guiding Questions:**
*How did the country promote or protect its industries?*
*Was industrialization state-led or market-driven?*
*What incentives exist for investment and innovation?*
*What sectors were targeted for development?*

| Period                               | Key Policies and Developments |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Import-Substitution Industrialization (ISI) (c. 1930-1975) | **State-led.** High tariffs and import quotas to protect domestic manufacturers. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) in steel, energy, and defense (e.g., SOMISA, YPF). Promotion of automotive, textile, and chemical industries. |
| The "Process" and Neoliberal Turn (1976-2001) | **Shift to market-driven.** Military junta liberalized finance. Menem administration in the 1990s privatized nearly all SOEs (YPF, railways, telecom, utilities), dismantled trade barriers, and promoted a commodity- and service-based model, leading to significant deindustrialization. |
| Post-2001 Heterodox Intervention (2002-2015) | **Return to state-led intervention.** Re-nationalization of YPF (2012) and Aerolíneas Argentinas. Use of export taxes on agricultural goods to fund industrial subsidies and control domestic prices. Import restrictions and non-automatic licensing to protect industry. |
| Current Era (2015-Present) | **Policy volatility.** Macri administration removed capital controls and reduced export taxes (2015-2019). Fernández administration re-imposed controls and protectionism. Milei administration (2023-) advocates for radical deregulation, spending cuts, and privatization, representing a stark shift away from industrial policy. |
