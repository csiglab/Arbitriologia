# Social Group

: 12

In the social sciences, a social group can be defined as two or more people interacting, sharing similar characteristics, and collectively having a sense of unity. Regardless, social groups come in a myriad of sizes and varieties. For example, a society can be viewed as a large social group.

The system of behaviors and psychological processes occurring within or between social groups is known as group dynamics.

In this note, we will explore the emergent phenomena of collections of humans interacting together.

Some of the interesting questions about social groups include: 

- ¿How does the size of the group impact its properties?
- ¿How does collective intelligence making take place?
- ¿How to design reputation systems?
- ¿How influence works in groups?
- In Social Networks; ¿Which topics have become trendy?
- ¿How do prediction markets aggregate knowledge?
- How does consensus arise in groups?

## Group Structure and Dynamics

> "Any kind of group activity requires **organization**. But as soon as one starts to organize one creates a **division** within the movement between the **organized** and the **organizers**, between ordinary members and officials. The latter quickly acquire knowledge and expertise that set them apart and give them power over ordinary members. The officials begin to derive personal satisfaction from their place in the organization and seek ways of consolidating it. They acquire an interest in the continued prosperity of the organization. For ordinary trade unionists, their union is just one interest in which they have a small stake. But for the paid officials the union is their employer. Preserving the organization becomes more important than helping it achieve its goals. As radical action may bring government repression, the apparatchiks moderate."
