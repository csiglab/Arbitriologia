# 🏛️ Public Administration

> In this note, we explore the conceptual, systemic, and operational dimensions of `Public Administration`.

> Also referred to as: State Administration, Government Administration, Public Sector Management, Administrative Science, or Administrative Systems (from an institutional perspective).

> Note: The term `Public Administration` is broad and can refer to multiple aspects: a research field, a body of reality encompassing the public sphere within a social system, and the specific elements associated with public actors.

> **Administration** is the design and evaluation of an architecture that articulates and structures a set of agents—composing a larger unit—in order to develop a coherent set of capacities capable of executing a series of tasks and running a set of processes.

## On This Note

> This note is highly abstract and icmplete - the formulation of the problem - the termionology to refere to reality - etc need to be better intregated -  and this READMEM should serve as the entry point to the Public Admionitration Praxis Field.

> How should a public entity be managed? How can all public entities be managed as a whole?

- A Research Field
- Phenomenology (Domain of Social Reality)
- Public Administration as Meta Administration: Public Administration can be understood as meta-administration when it is analyzed not merely as the execution of public tasks, but as the system that designs, governs, evaluates, and adapts administrative systems themselves.`

## Philosophy of Administration

> What is the essential role of Administration? Why does Administration exist?

> In essence, administration is the architecture of purposeful action, balancing guidance, empowerment, coordination, evaluation, and adaptation across complex systems.

Administration is not merely the execution of tasks; it is the systematic orchestration of actions within organizations and broader social systems. Its fundamental purpose can be understood through five core functions:

1. Guiding Action: Administration establishes norms, principles, and decision-making frameworks that shape organizational behavior. It defines what actors should do, in what sequence, and according to which values, priorities, or strategic objectives.

2. Enabling Action: Administration equips actors and agencies with the resources, authority, structures, and instruments necessary for effective performance. It empowers execution through mechanisms such as budgets, legal mandates, operational tools, and institutional support.

3. Coordinating Action: Administration harmonizes the efforts of multiple actors and agencies, ensuring that heterogeneous units work coherently toward shared objectives while preserving functional autonomy and specialization.

4. Evaluating Action: Administration monitors and assesses performance, outcomes, and compliance, generating feedback that supports continuous improvement, accountability, and informed decision-making.

5. Adaptive Action: Administration fosters organizational learning, innovation, and responsiveness to social, political, and technological change. By enabling adaptation, it sustains resilience, relevance, and long-term effectiveness.

## Scope

> What are the objects of public administration?

### Meta Public Administration

- Institutional Design
- Civil Service Governance
- Control and Accountability Systems
- Coordination and Steering
- Learning and Adaptation

### Public Agency Administration

> Focuses on the management of individual agencies, including:

- Operational processes and workflows
- Domain-specific HR and performance management
- Resource allocation and budgeting
- Stakeholder engagement and service delivery
- Risk management and compliance

## Workforce

> Human resources are the actors that compose the public workforce. They may belong to different legal statuses, such as the Civil Service, Police, or other public bodies.

> Note: In the future, these actors could be non-human or even hybrid.

## QA

### Is an Administrative System Even a “System”?

- In practice, administration is essentially the architecture that organizes actors into a coherent unit capable of action.
- One can call it a conceptual system, but the primary unit being built—the network of actors—is not itself the system.
- Rather, it is the administrative architecture that constitutes the system; the underlying connections among actors are conceptual, not operationally self-contained.

### Is the Meta Public Administration  a System?

> A meta-public administration is generally **not a standalone system** in the sense of having fully independent operational dynamics like a government agency or ministry. Rather, it functions as a complementary or higher-order layer: it observes, analyzes, integrates, and guides multiple public administration subsystems.

- Public Administration (standard): Operational systems, executing policies, managing resources, and delivering services.
- Meta-Public Administration: Reflexive layer, concerned with coordination, evaluation, and systemic design across the operational units. It does not directly implement services but shapes how the underlying administrative system functions.

### Why there is a conflict in common usage between “Public Administration” and “Public Institutions”?

> In everyday language, “Public Administration” and “Public Institutions” are often used interchangeably, but they refer to different concepts. Public Administration denotes the processes, structures, and functions involved in governing and managing the public sector, including decision-making, policy implementation, and internal organization. Public Institutions, by contrast, are the concrete organizations—ministries, agencies, and offices—that execute these functions. The conflict arises because ordinary usage tends to conflate the actors and structures (institutions) with the systematic processes and coordination mechanisms (administration).

### How should the workforce in public administration be conceptualized?

> ...

### What is the limit of administration? When is self-administration sufficient? How much administration is necessary? When is administration truly required? When does administration become excessive?

> ...

### Is Public Administration Generic or Agency-Specific?

**Public administration** can be conceptualized as a socio-technical system:

- **Generic layer** (Meta Administration) : Core administrative processes, governance mechanisms, accountability structures, and HR rules. Note that some HR models are agency-specific—for example, the performance evaluation model for researchers is fundamentally different from that used for police officers.
- **Agency-specific layer** (Agency Administration): Operational methods, domain-specific workflows, stakeholder engagement practices.

### Why “Public Administration” Can be Misleading Term?

> :)  In Search of Better Terminology.

What people typically conflate when they use the term Public Administration is the administration of the entire public sphere, rather than the management of specific agencies. A more precise term could clarify this distinction.

The term Public Administration is misleading because **it implies** that the public sector can be administered as a single, coherent object. In reality, the public sector is not a unitary system but a heterogeneous assemblage of agencies—ranging from research institutions and regulatory bodies to police forces, courts, schools, and hospitals. Each of these organizations operates under distinct mandates, goal functions, performance metrics, operational constraints, and professional logics.

Because of this heterogeneity, there is no single administrative framework that can be meaningfully or optimally applied across the entire public sector. What is administrable is not “the public sector as such,” but rather individual agencies or classes of agencies, each requiring management structures tailored to its specific function, risk profile, epistemic environment, and accountability regime.

What is conventionally called **Public Administration** is therefore **better** understood as **Meta–Public Administration**. Its object is not direct administration, but the governance of a space of heterogeneous public actors. At this level, the task is necessarily abstract and systemic: designing coordination mechanisms, incentive structures, oversight architectures, legal interfaces, and information flows that allow diverse agencies—each with its own internal administrative framework—to function coherently within the state as a whole.

In this sense, Meta–Public Administration operates one level above agency-specific management. It must interact with, but cannot substitute for, the concrete administrative systems required for optimal behavior within each organization. Its role is to shape the conditions under which differentiated administrative regimes can coexist, align where necessary, and remain collectively viable.
