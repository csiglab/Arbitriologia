# Preference Modelling

> Preference modelling is the formal representation and analysis of how individuals or agents rank, evaluate, or choose among a set of alternatives. It seeks to capture the decision-maker’s subjective tastes, priorities, and trade-offs by defining mathematical structures—such as preference relations and utility functions—that reflect their ordering of options. This modelling enables predictions of choice behavior under certainty or uncertainty, facilitates comparison of alternatives, and forms the foundation for economic analysis, game theory, and decision theory.

## Marginal Utilty

> **Marginalism** is an **economic theory** that analyzes how individuals make decisions based on the additional **(marginal) benefit or cost** of a small incremental change in the consumption or production of goods and services.

> Marx as the forerunner of marginalism in economics? He knew better! My new post. *Marx*, *Marginalism, and the True Nature of Capitalism*. - Dmitry Pozhidaev


> Marginalism revolution pioner by Jevons, Walras and Menger.

> **Marginal utility** is the additional satisfaction or benefit that a consumer derives from consuming an additional unit of a good or service.
