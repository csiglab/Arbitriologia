# State (Snapshot)

> A state of a system (snapshot) is a complete description of all relevant variables, properties, and conditions that characterize the system at a specific moment in time.

> Note: Not  to be confuse with State as in (Polity).

> Note: This concept of state should not be confused with State in the sense of a political entity (polity). In systems theory, the state of a system at a particular moment is simply the set of values that fully captures its current condition.
