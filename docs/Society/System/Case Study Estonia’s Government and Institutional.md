State Anatomy:

- **Legislative**: The Riigikogu (Parliament) enacts laws and approves the state budget.
- **Executive**: The President (head of state) and the Government (headed by the Prime Minister) implement laws and policies.
- **Judiciary**: Independent courts ensure the enforcement of laws and uphold constitutional principles.

## Civil Service

> Some of the civil service selection, training, working contracts are very strict.
> 

> **Reader**: I value self-organization, adaptability, and localized decision-making guided by a minimal set of rules; **strict** specification; and **freedom of implementation;** with a very strong **auditing** to analyze the functioning of the system; see deviations; and **regulate** the bad behaviors.

## **Production & Research Institutional** Architecture

> Growth Measure; Very basic stable macro-economic environment;  free-trade (they have a **floating exchange rate scheme** (so in order to buy; one have to sell));  not corporate income tax on reinvested profits;  attract FDI,
> 

> Which kinds of FDI where attracted?
> 

> Estonia started its journey toward becoming a digital society, investing in telecommunications and internet infrastructure.
> 

> Privatizations:  Large industries, including manufacturing and energy, were sold to private investors, often through auctions or voucher-based systems.
> 

> Manufacturing: The government encouraged the revival of manufacturing industries like electronics, machinery, and textiles, which were less dependent on Soviet-era trade.
> 

> IT and Technology: While not initially a focus of the industrial policy, investments in technology and telecommunications in the late 1990s laid the groundwork for Estonia's future as a digital economy.
> 

> Estonia adopted a **laissez-faire** approach to **industrial policy**, avoiding direct government intervention or subsidies. Reader:  I don’t like the  **laissez-faire** tag here;  because they work to attract **sectorial investments**.
