 # An Essay on the Relation of the Macroeconomy and Technoeconomic Progress

 > ...

 > Take the Case of Meiji Japan

 > No, the macro condition was not good initially. But Japan achieved technoeconomic progress despite this, and eventually, that progress helped improve the macroeconomy.

## ðŸ”» Early Meiji Macroeconomic Conditions (c. 1868â€“1881)

- Currency chaos: Multiple types of currencies (clan notes, coins of varying standards) circulated. Inflation was high.

- No central bank: Japan lacked a unified monetary authority until the Bank of Japan was established in 1882.

- Large fiscal deficits: Government spendingâ€”especially on military, infrastructure, and industrializationâ€”was high, but revenue was weak.

- Land-tax reform (1873): This fixed land taxes as a stable revenue source but also caused rural hardship and unrest.

- Foreign loans: Japan relied on foreign borrowing and indemnities from the Sino-Japanese and 
Russo-Japanese wars to stabilize finances later.

## ðŸ”§ How Technoeconomic Progress Still Advanced

Despite poor macro fundamentals, Japan succeeded in rapid industrial modernization through:

- Central institutional coordination (e.g., MITIâ€™s predecessors).

- Directed state investment in priority sectors (textiles, steel, shipping).

- Technology imports and licensingâ€”including reverse engineering and knowledge absorption.

- Human capital formationâ€”sending elites abroad and founding technical schools domestically.

- Privatization of state-owned model factories to emerging domestic capitalists (zaibatsu), ensuring scaling without ongoing state burden.
