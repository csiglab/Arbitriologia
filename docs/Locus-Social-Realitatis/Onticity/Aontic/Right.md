# Rights

A right, empirically analyzed, can be seen as a socially recognized expectation or claim that organizes interactions between agents.

Note: This study focuses on how rights function in social reality, rather than tracing their mythological or historical origins.

## Ontological Nature

> A right is a socially recognized relational construct whereby an individual or collective (the right-holder) has a legitimate claim that obligates one or more other agents (duty-bearers) to act, refrain from acting, or permit certain actions. This claim derives its force from the normative, institutional, or cultural frameworks in which it is embedded, and it exists only insofar as the network of agents collectively acknowledges, enforces, and respects it. A right is therefore inherently relational, context-dependent, and contingent upon mechanisms of recognition and enforcement.

- **Expectation** – The anticipation that certain behaviors or outcomes will be respected by others.
- **Promise** – Implicit or explicit commitments that others will act or refrain from acting in certain ways.
- **Normative Force** - – Rights carry a binding moral or social weight; they generate duties or obligations in others.
- Social Constructedness – Rights are instantiated only within social contexts that recognize and uphold them.

## Formulation

A **right** is a socially instantiated relational construct (R(a, b, C)) defined over a set of agents (A = {a, b, ...}) and context (C), such that:

1. **Relational claim:** For an agent (a) (the right-holder), there exists a directed normative relation toward one or more agents (b) (duty-bearers), specifying that (b) must perform, abstain from, or permit certain actions.
2. **Normative force:** The relation carries socially recognized obligations or duties, which are enforced through legal, institutional, cultural, or reputational mechanisms within (C).
3. **Contextual dependence:** The content, scope, and enforceability of $(R)$ are defined by the structural, legal, and institutional parameters of $(C)$.
4. **Empirical observability:** The right is instantiated only insofar as the network of agents $(A)$ collectively acknowledges and acts according to the relation $(R)$.

Formally, one can represent a right as a function: $R : A \times A \times C \rightarrow {0,1}$

where $(R(a, b, C) = 1)$ if agent $(a)$ possesses a right against agent $(b)$ in context $(C)$, and $(0)$ otherwise.

## Property(s)

- **Relational Property** – Rights exist in relation to agents. Saying “I have a right” always implies “others have duties” toward me. Without the network of agents who recognize and enforce it, a right would be ontologically hollow.
- **Enforceability Property** – The effectiveness of a right depends on mechanisms (legal, social, cultural) that support its recognition and protection.

## Theory of Rights

> A structured framework that explains the nature, emergence, relational properties, and functioning of rights in social systems.

> Note: Each theory presented focuses on a specific perspective or “silo” of rights. A complete understanding of rights requires considering their emergence, historical development, evolution across social contexts, and interactions between different theoretical perspectives. No single theory fully explains the ontological, normative, functional, and empirical dimensions of rights on its own.

| **Relational Theory**                  | Rights exist only in relation to agents. A right implies corresponding duties for others and cannot be ontologically separated from the social network that recognizes it. | Hohfeld, Feinberg          |
| **Normative Theory**                   | Rights carry moral, legal, or social weight, generating obligations that guide behavior and justify claims.                                                                | Locke, Kant, Dworkin       |
| **Functional Theory**                  | Rights serve specific functions in society, such as protecting interests, coordinating cooperation, reducing conflict, and enabling collective action.                     | Bentham, Hart, Raz         |
| **Constructivist Theory** | Rights are socially constructed; their scope, content, and enforceability depend on cultural, legal, and institutional contexts.                                           | Habermas, Rawls, MacIntyre |
| **Operational Theory**     | Rights are observable in practice through behaviors, enforcement mechanisms, and recognition by institutions and agents.                                                   | Posner, Tamanaha, Coleman  |
