# Models of Cultural Evolution

**Cultural Evolution Models:**

- **Unilinear Evolution:** This model posits that all societies follow a single, linear path of cultural evolution, progressing from simple to complex stages. It has mainly been discredited for its ethnocentrism.
- **Multilinear Evolution:** Unlike unilinear evolution, multilinear evolution suggests that different societies can follow unique development paths, reaching complexity through various means.
