# Representation

> Political Representation: The process by which individuals or groups (constituents) authorize others (representatives) to act on their behalf in political decision-making, policy formulation, or governance. Representation entails both authorization (delegation of authority) and accountability (obligation of the representative to act in the interests of the represented).

## Ontology Signature

> What is the ontological nature of the concept of representation?

> Representation is a relational and social-structural concept. It exists not as a material entity but as a pattern of relationships between agents (representatives) and principals (the represented), mediated by authority, trust, and accountability. Its existence is context-dependent: it is instantiated through political institutions, legal frameworks, and social norms that enable and constrain the delegation of agency.

Key Ontological Features:

- **Relational**: Defined by the interaction between representative and represented.
- **Functional**: Exists to perform the social function of translating collective interests into decisions and actions.
- **Normatively Embedded**: Grounded in expectations of legitimacy, fidelity, and accountability.
- **Contextual - Institutional**: Its instantiation depends on political, legal, and cultural structures.
- **Dynamic**: Evolves as institutions, norms, and agent behaviors change.

## Relatd Ideas

- **Delegation**: A relational concept where authority, responsibility, or decision-making power is transferred from one actor (principal) to another (agent), often within a political, organizational, or social context. Delegation presupposes trust, mechanisms of control, and clarity about the scope of authority.

- **Agency**: The capacity of representatives to act independently while being accountable to those they represent.

- **Mandate vs. Trustee Models**: Different forms of representation where representatives either strictly follow constituent preferences (mandate) or use judgment to act in what they perceive as constituents’ best interest (trustee).

- **Political Legitimacy**: Representation supports legitimacy when it aligns with the collective will, legal frameworks, and social expectations.
