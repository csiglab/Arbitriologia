# Kinship System

> A **Kinship System** is a non-ontic social structure in which **agents** occupy roles, governed by norms and shared cultural meanings, giving rise to emergent relational patterns without the system itself being a tangible entity.

QA:

- what which kinds of systems does kinshsip belongs to? Relational System, Normative System,  Symbolic System - Emergent System.

- Does the role actually reprsent a tpe of link in teh scial network defined by th esytem?

## Ontology

> What is the ontological nature of the entity 'Kinship System'? What is the structure of such 'system'?

> A kinship system does not exist as a physical object; you cannot touch it like a tree or a rock.

> It exists in social reality, i.e., it is real because people collectively recognize and act according to it.

> Philosophically, this aligns with Searle’s notion of “institutional facts”: entities that exist because humans assign functions or statuses to them (e.g., money, property, government roles).

> Relational:  A kinship system is not reducible to individuals alone. It is a pattern of relations among agents, often formalized in anthropology via diagrams, rules, or categories.

> Relational: Its ontological status is emergent: it arises from repeated interactions and shared cognition, but is not identical to any single interaction.

> Normative: A kinship system includes norms and rules—about who can marry whom, how inheritance works, obligations, etc.

> Note: These kinds of systems are informal, and not all agents will recognize the system in its entirety. If the system is complex, the underlying relations exist, but each agent’s interpretation may differ. Consequently, the notion of the “same system” should be taken with a grain of salt.

> A kinship system is an abstract social structure, ontologically real within the social realm, emergent from human interactions and maintained by collective recognition and normative practices.

> Kinship is a social, relational, normative, cultural, and emergent system. It is an informal social system that organizes human relationships, shapes obligations, and carries cultural meaning.

## Structure

> A **kinship system** is a structured social framework where agents occupy roles, follow norms, and participate in shared cultural-symbolic practices. Relations (e.g., parent, sibling) emerge from these fundamental components rather than being primitive themselves.

> Note: A Role implies certain kinds of interactions (i.e., the types of relations that may arise between agents occupying roles), but it is **not itself a relation**. Roles define the **potential patterns of connection**, whereas actual relations emerge only when agents occupy roles and norms dictate permissible interactions.

- **Agents**: Individuals who occupy social positions in the system (e.g., people in a family, household, or lineage).
- **Role**: Socially recognized positions that agents occupy (e.g., father, mother, sibling, cousin). Roles may persist beyond any single individual.
- **Norm**: Rules and obligations that define which roles are permissible, expected behaviors, and allowable interactions.
- Cultural-Symbolic Layer (Interpretation): The shared meanings, identities, and practices that give the system coherence.
