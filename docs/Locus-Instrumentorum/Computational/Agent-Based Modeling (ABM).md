# Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)

- Key idea: Economy as a complex adaptive system with heterogeneous interacting agents.
- Modeling focus: Bottom-up simulation rather than closed-form equilibrium.
- Tools: Computational simulations, cellular automata, network models.
- Strength: Captures emergent phenomena, non-equilibrium dynamics.
