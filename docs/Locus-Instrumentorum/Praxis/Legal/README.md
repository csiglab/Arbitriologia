# Legal Theory

> Legal Theory (also called Jurisprudence) is the philosophical and conceptual study of law. It seeks to understand the nature, purposes, sources, and functions of law and legal systems. It bridges philosophy, politics, sociology, and ethics to analyze what law is, what it ought to be, and how it operates in society.

## Core Questions of Legal Theory

- What is law?  What distinguishes law from other social rules, customs, or moral norms?
- What is the relationship between law and morality?  Are laws inherently moral, or can law be morally neutral?
- What is legal authority and legitimacy?  Why should people obey the law?
- How should judges interpret the law?  What methods and principles guide legal reasoning?
- What is the role of law in society?  How does law maintain order, facilitate justice, or serve power?

| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Legal Positivism**          | Law is a system of rules based on social facts; separate from morality.                 | Rule of Recognition, Legal Validity     | H.L.A. Hart, Joseph Raz                  |
| **Natural Law Theory**        | Law is grounded in inherent moral principles; law and morality are connected.           | Moral Foundations, Universal Principles | John Finnis, Thomas Aquinas              |
| **Legal Realism**             | Law is what officials actually do; focuses on social and political influences on law.   | Judicial Behavior, Pragmatism           | Karl Llewellyn, Jerome Frank             |
| **Critical Legal Studies**    | Law serves power structures and social hierarchies; law is indeterminate and political. | Indeterminacy, Power, Ideology          | Roberto Mangabeira Unger, Duncan Kennedy |
| **Law and Economics**         | Law should be designed and interpreted based on economic efficiency and incentives.     | Efficiency, Cost-Benefit Analysis       | Richard Posner, Guido Calabresi          |
| **Dworkinian Interpretivism** | Law includes moral principles requiring interpretation for coherence and justice.       | Law as Integrity, Principles over Rules | Ronald Dworkin                           |

## Interdisciplinary Connections

Legal theory intersects with:

- Political Philosophy (justice, rights, sovereignty)
- Ethics (moral reasoning, human rights)
- Sociology of Law (law in social context)
- Economics (efficiency, incentives)
- History (development of legal systems)
