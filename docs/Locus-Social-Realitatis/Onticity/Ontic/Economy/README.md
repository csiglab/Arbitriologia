### Economic Interaction Space

> An **action space** refers to the set of all possible actions or choices that an agent or decision-maker can take in a given situation or environment. It represents the range of options available to an entity when making decisions or performing actions to achieve a specific goal or objective.
> 

- How can we alter society so that some goals are achieved?
- How do changes in economic policies affect consumer behavior?
- What is the optimal tax policy to promote economic efficiency and equity?
- What are behavioral macroeconomics' implications for monetary and fiscal policy, and how can policy be designed to account for economic behavioral factors?
