# Power

> Power is a property defined in terms of relations and agents.

> Power, in its most general sense, is the capacity to influence, shape, or constrain the decision space of other agents—or even of groups of agents.

> Note: `Power` is primarily classified as a relational concept in our ontology, but it also exhibits dynamics, context-dependence, and emergent properties.

> Note: Our Initent as wayls is technical description - an modelling - not how to cmake a coup :)

- It's power a property of an agent in relatation with others agents?

| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Power as Domination**             | Power as the ability to compel obedience or enforce compliance, often through coercion or control of resources. | Max Weber, Thomas Hobbes       |
| **Power as Influence**              | Power as the capacity to shape others’ preferences or decisions without direct coercion.                        | Robert Dahl, Joseph Nye        |
| **Power as Structure**              | Power embedded in institutional, economic, and cultural systems that shape possibilities of action.             | Karl Marx, Louis Althusser     |
| **Power as Discourse**              | Power operates through language, knowledge, and norms that define what can be thought or said.                  | Michel Foucault                |
| **Power as Capacity / Empowerment** | Power understood as the collective or individual ability to act, to realize goals, or to transform conditions.  | Hannah Arendt, Amartya Sen     |
| **Power as Network Effect**         | Power arises from one’s position within social, economic, or informational networks.                            | Manuel Castells, Bruno Latour  |
| **Power as Systemic Control**       | Power maintained through feedback mechanisms, regulation, and cybernetic governance.                            | Niklas Luhmann, Norbert Wiener |

## Signature

> What is the ontological nature of the concept of power?

- Category: Relational and **emergent property**
- Substrate: Exists only within social contexts; does not have independent material existence but manifests through actions, structures, and norms.

## Property

- Relational: Requires at least two entities — one that exercises power, one over which power is exercised.
- Dynamic: Can increase, decrease, or shift depending on social, political, or economic conditions.
- Context-dependent: Its expression and recognition vary across cultures, historical periods, and institutional arrangements.
- Latent vs. Manifest: Power may exist in potential (structural, institutional) or in observable actions (decisions, coercion, influence).

## Dynamics

## Mechanism(s)

> How does power operates? Which strategies are used?

- Authority: Legitimate and institutionalized power recognized by social norms.
- Influence: Power operates by shaping the beliefs, preferences, or perceptions of other agents, guiding their decisions without direct coercion.
- Control of Resources: By controlling access to critical resources (information, wealth, tools, or networks), power constrains or enables options available to others.
- Norms and Legitimacy: Power is exercised through the establishment, reinforcement, or manipulation of social norms, rules, and institutional legitimacy.
- Coercion and Enforcement: Power can manifest as the ability to impose costs or penalties, compelling compliance through threats or force.
- Structural Embedding: Power is embedded in social, organizational, or institutional structures, creating latent influence even without direct action.

## Manifestation(s)

- Influence: Ability to shape others’ behavior without coercion.
- Coercion: Capacity to compel compliance through threat or force.
- Control of Resources: Power tied to access to critical economic, informational, or technological assets.

| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Coordination**            | Aligns agents toward shared objectives and collective action.                           | Governance, organizational leadership, strategic planning.                 |
| **Control**                 | Regulates behavior and enforces rules to maintain order.                                | Law enforcement, institutional discipline, administrative hierarchies.     |
| **Distribution**            | Allocates resources, opportunities, and recognition within a system.                    | Budgeting, promotions, access to information or capital.                   |
| **Transformation**          | Drives or resists change in social, political, or technological structures.             | Social reform, revolution, innovation policy, or resistance movements.     |
| **Protection**              | Preserves autonomy and defends interests or stability against threats.                  | National defense, organizational security, preservation of rights.         |

| **Decision Influence**        | Assesses the capacity of an agent or group to shape or constrain decisions within a system.             | Process tracing, voting records, agenda-setting analysis, influence mapping.     |
| **Institutional Embedding**   | Looks at how formal and informal rules structure and stabilize power relations.                         | Institutional analysis, rule tracing, comparative policy studies.                |
| **Perception and Legitimacy** | Evaluates how power is recognized, accepted, or contested socially.                                     | Surveys, discourse analysis, legitimacy indices, media framing studies.          |
