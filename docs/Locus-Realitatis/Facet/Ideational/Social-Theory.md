# Social Theory

> **Social Theory** is both a set of methods for studying social reality and a framework for normation.

QA:

- What are the target of study of social theory?
- Do we have some biological principles that ground this high level phenomena?

## Terminology

> **Human**:  A biological organism of species Homo sapiens, characterized by self-consciousness, symbolic reasoning, sociality, and the capacity to generate and be governed by frameworks of meaning and normativity. See more in [Human](../../Locus-Realitatis/Unit/Human.md)

> **Humanism**: An intellectual and ethical stance that emphasizes the value, dignity, and agency of human beings, often prioritizing reason, education, and moral development.

> **Humanity**: The collective condition, experience, and qualities of being human, encompassing compassion, social responsibility, and shared existence.

> **Sociology**: The scientific study of social behavior, institutions, structures, and collective frameworks. Sociology seeks to understand how societies are organized, maintained, and transformed over time.

> **Anthropology**:  The holistic study of humans across time and space, encompassing biological, cultural, linguistic, and archaeological perspectives. In relation to frameworks, anthropology examines both collective and personal systems of meaning across diverse cultures.

> **Legal Theory**: A systematic framework for understanding the nature, purpose, and application of law in society.

> **Economy**: The study and organization of production, distribution, and consumption of resources, including institutions, policies, and behaviors that shape economic outcomes.

> **Culture**: The set of shared practices, beliefs, norms, and symbolic systems that structure social life and collective meaning.

> **Progress**: The processes and measures by which societies advance materially, socially, and institutionally over time.

> **Society**: A structured, organized network of human relations, institutions, and cultural systems, bound together by shared frameworks, practices, and modes of cooperation or conflict. Society is the medium in which collective frameworks are instantiated.

>  **Civilization:** A comparative criterion for evaluating societies, referring to the complex social, cultural, political, and technological organization of human groups, characterized by institutions, cities, shared norms, and accumulated knowledge.

## Theory

> A set of theories at multiple levels of  abstraction - scope and generalty.

### Nature

> What is the nature of these theories? What is the level of description?

- **Descriptive** – Explains how social reality operates.
- **Proactive** – Analyzes possible futures and guides agency through cognition, reflection, action, and interaction. Alternative terms could include Normation - Change Coordination, etc.
- **Moral (Conduct of Life)**– Addresses the principles, values, and orientations that guide individual and collective conduct; concerns the formation of character, ethos, and practical reason in shaping lived experience and social coexistence.
- **Legal** – Establishes, codifies, or formalizes social relations through norms, rights, and duties; defines the legitimacy and boundaries of action and interaction within an institutional order. Operates at the level of social rule-formation and regulatory rationalization.
- **Meta-Theoretical** – Provides overarching frameworks that organize other theories.
- **Epistemic Tool** – Offers tools for understanding and analyzing social structures and interactions.

### Principle

> Which are the principles that govern the social sphere? What are the principles that govern our representation of the social sphere?

> Foundational orientations and commitments in social theory that shape how theories interpret society, history, and human action.

- Anti-necessitarian social theory → Rejects deterministic or “necessary” laws of social development. Affirms the contingency of institutions, the plasticity of structures, and the possibility of alternative futures. Highlights agency, creativity, and historical openness rather than inevitability.
- Necessitarian social theory → Posits that social structures and historical outcomes follow necessary laws or stages (e.g., classical Marxism’s progression of modes of production). Emphasizes structural constraints and inevitability in development.
- Structuralist orientation → Focuses on deep, enduring social structures (economic, linguistic, cultural) that organize human life and constrain agency. Change occurs through shifts in these structures.
- Voluntarist orientation → Emphasizes human will, intentionality, and choice as primary drivers of social reality, sometimes downplaying structural limits.
- Functionalist orientation → Views social institutions in terms of their functions for maintaining order, stability, and systemic reproduction.
- Critical orientation → Sees social theory as inherently evaluative, oriented toward critique of domination, inequality, and ideology, with an implicit or explicit emancipatory goal.
- Pragmatist orientation → Treats social theory as a tool for problem-solving in concrete contexts, emphasizing experimentation, adaptation, and practical consequences.

| **Foucauldian (Power-Knowledge)**                | Discourses + institutions → norms → power relations     | Social reality is shaped by historical power/knowledge regimes; institutions and discourses produce social “truths.”                      | Foucault, discourse, power, knowledge           |
| **Autopoietic (Luhmann)**                        | Communication systems → self-production → social order  | Society consists of self-producing communications; individuals are secondary to system operations.                                        | Luhmann, system, autopoiesis, communication     |
| **Symbolic Interactionism (Mead, Blumer)**       | Micro interactions → symbols → social self              | Social reality emerges through interaction; the self and society are co-constructed via symbolic communication.                           | Interactionism, symbols, self, micro            |
| **Unger’s Transformative (Plastic)**             | Institutions → human agency → social potential          | Social reality is malleable; institutions can be reshaped; emphasis on transformative human action.                                       | Unger, plasticity, agency, institutional change |

## Economic Theory

> A systematic framework for understanding the production, distribution, and consumption of resources, analyzing how economic agents behave, markets function, and policies shape societal outcomes.

> Note: Many of these so-called “theories” are often just labels with political or ideological motivations, such as “Capitalism.”

> Note: This table presents common conceptions or definitions of economic systems. For example, Mercantilism was not a formal theory but a practical strategy aimed at making a nation wealthy. It lacked a shared methodology or systematic framework, so characterizing Mercantilism merely as a theory of trade is misleading.
