| 2021        | 1.84                    | Lowest average tariff rate, indicating high trade liberalization.

**Key Historical Context:**

* **1858–1899:** Japan's tariff autonomy was restricted due to unequal treaties with Western powers, capping tariffs at 5%. ([Microeconomic Insights][5])

* **Post-1899:** Japan regained control over its tariff policy, allowing for adjustments to protect and develop domestic industries.&#x20;

* **Post-WWII Period:** Tariffs were utilized to shield nascent industries during reconstruction.

* **Late 20th Century:** Japan progressively reduced tariffs, aligning with global trade liberalization trends.

* **21st Century:** Japan maintains low average tariff rates, though certain sectors like agriculture still have higher protections.
