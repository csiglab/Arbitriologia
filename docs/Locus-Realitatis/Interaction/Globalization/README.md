# Globalization

> The idea is as old as civilization itself: the mental globalization that extrapolates the known into the unknown. Long before actual geographic globalization, ancient rulers often believed they ruled the entire world — a classic fallacy of mistaking the limits of one's knowledge for the limits of reality.

> Globalization is a multi-scalar, evolving regime of intensified interaction, integration, and interdependence across economic, technological, political, cultural, and informational domains among geographically distributed actors.

| **Historical Process**        | Evolving over centuries, shaped by institutional, technological, and material changes |

## Structure

| **Characteristic** | **Description**                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Multi-domain**   | Operates across economic, cultural, political, ecological, and technological realms |
| **Scalar Layered** | Includes local-global feedback loops and multilevel actors                          |
| **Path-Dependent** | Shaped by colonialism, Cold War, industrialization paths                            |
| **Crisis-Prone**   | Generates fragilities—pandemics, financial contagion, supply disruptions            |
| **Ambivalent**     | Simultaneously integrates and polarizes; unifies and fragments                      |
