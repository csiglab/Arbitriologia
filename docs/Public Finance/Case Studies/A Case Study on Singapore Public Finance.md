    Key Features:

        Low but Broad-Based Taxes: Competitive corporate tax (17%), moderate income tax (top rate 24%), and a 9% GST (rising to 9% in 2024).

        State Capitalism: Temasek Holdings and GIC (sovereign wealth funds) invest government reserves globally, generating returns that supplement taxes.

        CPF (Central Provident Fund): Mandatory savings scheme funds pensions, healthcare, and housing.

    Why It Works:

        High compliance due to efficient tax administration (IRAS).

        Investment returns reduce reliance on taxes (about 20% of revenue comes from investments).
