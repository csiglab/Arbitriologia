# General Equilibrium Theory

> Is an fundamental asusmption make in clasical / an neo classical economic modelling in which  attempts to explain the behavior of supply, demand, and prices in a 
whole economy with several or many interacting markets, by seeking to 
prove that the interaction of demand and supply will result in an 
overall [general equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_types_of_equilibrium#Economics).

> In general equilibrium, constant influences are considered to be 
noneconomic, or in other words, considered to be beyond the scope of 
economic analysis.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_equilibrium_theory#cite_note-1)

> The noneconomic influences may change given changes in the economic 
factors however, and therefore the prediction accuracy of an equilibrium
 model may depend on the independence of the economic factors from 
noneconomic ones.

## Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Models

- Key idea: Calibrated general equilibrium models for policy simulation.
- Modeling focus: Market-clearing with multiple sectors, agents, and policies.
- Tools: Numerical computation, calibration to data.
- Applications: Trade policy, tax policy, climate change economics.
