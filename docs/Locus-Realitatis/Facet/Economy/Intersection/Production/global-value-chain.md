## Value Distribution Across (GVCs)

> The most value in global value chains is generally captured by firms involved in high-skilled, knowledge-based activities such as R&D, design, and branding, primarily located in developed countries. In contrast, developing countries often capture lower value due to their focus on lower-skilled manufacturing and raw material exports. **This imbalance highlights the importance of moving up the value chain for economic growth, as countries seek to develop industries and capabilities that capture higher value in global markets.**

The distribution of value across global value chains (GVCs) varies depending on the industry, country, and position within the chain, with significant implications for wealth, employment, and economic development worldwide.

### 1. **Upstream Activities: Raw Materials and Extraction**

- Countries and companies involved in the extraction of raw materials, such as agriculture, mining, or energy, generally capture a small portion of the total value in GVCs. These activities often involve high production costs and low margins. Countries rich in natural resources, like some in Africa and South America, frequently rely on raw materials as primary exports but struggle to capture higher value due to limited processing and manufacturing capacities.

### 2. **Manufacturing and Assembly**

- **Low and Middle-Income Countries**: Many developing economies, particularly in East and Southeast Asia, such as Vietnam, Thailand, and Bangladesh, have become hubs for manufacturing due to lower labor costs. However, these countries typically capture only a moderate share of value, as they are often limited to labor-intensive, lower-skill assembly roles within GVCs.
- **Higher-Income Manufacturing Economies**: China has captured more significant value in GVCs due to its advanced manufacturing capabilities, moving beyond assembly to more complex and higher-value tasks like electronics, machinery, and chemical production. Still, China and similar economies capture less value than firms that control design, branding, and technology.

### 3. **Midstream Activities: Component Production and Specialized Inputs**

- Firms that produce specialized components, like semiconductors or machinery parts, often capture higher value than basic manufacturers, especially in technologically intensive industries. For example, firms from countries like Japan, Germany, and South Korea, which excel in high-precision manufacturing, capture a relatively large share of value through their expertise in producing high-quality components for global markets.

### 4. **Downstream Activities: Branding, Marketing, and Retail**

- The largest share of value in GVCs is often captured by companies that control branding, design, and retail. Developed countries, especially the United States, dominate in this area, as companies like Apple, Nike, and Google secure significant profits through their ownership of intellectual property, marketing, and direct consumer relationships.
- This portion of the value chain is also characterized by high barriers to entry due to established brand equity, technological know-how, and control over intellectual property, allowing these firms to earn substantial margins compared to manufacturers and suppliers.

### 5. **Emerging Trends in Digital and Platform-Driven Value Capture**

- In recent years, value capture has increasingly concentrated within digital platforms and tech firms that control critical data and digital ecosystems. These companies, like Amazon, Alibaba, and Google, are able to capture a large share of value by leveraging network effects, data analytics, and customer relationships, essentially coordinating and controlling the GVCs without owning traditional production assets.

### 6. **Services and After-Sales Support**

- An increasing share of GVC value is being captured through post-sale services, including maintenance, software updates, and customer support. This trend is particularly strong in industries like automotive, aerospace, and IT. Service-oriented economies like the U.S. and Western Europe gain a significant portion of their GVC earnings from these ongoing relationships, which tend to generate recurring revenue streams.
