### **Conceptual Taxonomy of Demand Analysis**

| **Category** | **Subcategory** | **Description** | **Key Metrics/Tools** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Types of Demand** | Consumer Demand | Desire for goods or services by end-users. | Price elasticity, consumer preferences | Understand buying behavior. |
|  | Market Demand | Total demand for a product or service in a market. | Total market size, market penetration rate | Assess overall market potential. |
|  | Derived Demand | Demand for a good/service resulting from the demand for another. | Raw materials, component analysis | Analyze interdependencies in production. |
|  | Latent Demand | Demand that exists but is not yet realized in the market. | Gap analysis, market surveys | Identify new opportunities. |
| **Determinants of Demand** | Price Factors | Impact of product pricing on demand. | Price elasticity of demand (PED) | Optimize pricing strategies. |
|  | Income Factors | Influence of consumer income levels on demand. | Income elasticity of demand (IED) | Predict demand shifts with economic changes. |
|  | Substitutes and Complements | Effect of related goods on demand. | Cross-price elasticity | Assess competition and bundling effects. |
|  | Preferences and Trends | Influence of consumer preferences and cultural trends. | Consumer surveys, trend analysis | Adapt to changing consumer tastes. |
| **Demand Patterns** | Seasonal Demand | Fluctuations in demand based on seasons or events. | Historical sales data, seasonality index | Plan for peak and off-peak periods. |
|  | Cyclical Demand | Demand influenced by broader economic cycles. | Economic indicators, time series analysis | Prepare for economic expansions/recessions. |
|  | Irregular Demand | Unpredictable changes in demand due to external factors. | Event analysis, scenario planning | Manage volatility and risks. |
| **Forecasting Methods** | Qualitative Forecasting | Relies on expert judgment and market insights. | Delphi method, market research | Use when historical data is limited. |
|  | Quantitative Forecasting | Utilizes mathematical and statistical models. | Time series analysis, regression models | Predict future demand with historical trends. |
|  | Short-Term Forecasting | Predicts demand over a short period (weeks/months). | Moving averages, exponential smoothing | Optimize immediate inventory and resources. |
|  | Long-Term Forecasting | Estimates demand over extended periods (years). | Econometric models, scenario analysis | Inform strategic planning and investments. |
| **Measurement Metrics** | Elasticity of Demand | Measures responsiveness of demand to changes in price, income, or substitutes. | PED, IED, cross-price elasticity | Refine pricing, marketing, and product strategies. |
|  | Demand Variability | Degree of fluctuation in demand over time. | Coefficient of variation, volatility index | Adjust inventory and supply chain management. |
| **Analysis Tools** | Surveys and Questionnaires | Collect consumer opinions and preferences. | Consumer feedback, market research tools | Understand target audience needs. |
|  | Statistical Software | Analyze large datasets for demand patterns. | R, Python, SPSS, Excel | Perform detailed quantitative analysis. |
|  | Predictive Analytics Tools | Leverage AI and machine learning for forecasting. | Tableau, Power BI, SAP Analytics | Enhance demand prediction accuracy. |
| **Applications** | Inventory Planning | Align inventory levels with demand forecasts. | Safety stock calculation, reorder points | Reduce stockouts and overstock. |
|  | Pricing Strategy | Optimize pricing to maximize revenue or market share. | Dynamic pricing models, competitor analysis | Capture consumer willingness to pay. |
|  | Marketing and Promotions | Design campaigns to influence demand. | Promotion response analysis, ROI tracking | Drive sales and consumer engagement. |
|  | Capacity Planning | Match production capacity to expected demand. | Load forecasting, bottleneck analysis | Minimize under- or over-utilization. |
