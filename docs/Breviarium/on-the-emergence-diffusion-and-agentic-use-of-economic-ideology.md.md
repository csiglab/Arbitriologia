# On the Emergence, Diffusion, and Agentic Use of Economic Ideology

> An Investigation into the Formation, Circulation, and Strategic Used of Economic Discourse.

Guiding Quesation:

- How does economic discourse emerge within specific historical, institutional, and productive contexts?

- Through what mechanisms does economic discourse diffuse across countries, elites, and policy networks?

- How is economic discourse agentically used by different actors (states, advisors, firms, international organizations)?

- Under what conditions does economic advice become hegemonic, contested, or ignored?

- How does discourse translate into policy action, institutional design, or structural transformation?

## Formulation

- Economic discourse: A structured set of concepts, metaphors, causal narratives, and normative claims used to interpret and prescribe economic action.

- Agentic use: The strategic deployment of discourse by actors to justify, coordinate, legitimize, or constrain action.

- Diffusion: Transmission through epistemic communities, advisory roles, education systems, international organizations, and imitation under uncertainty.

## Case Study

1. British Economic Advice to the United States (18th–19th Century)
    - British classical economists’ advocacy of agriculture and free trade.
    - Adam Smith, Ricardo, and the implicit assumption of Britain’s industrial comparative advantage.
    - U.S. rejection via Hamilton, List, and the American System.
    - Discursive conflict between universalist theory and national development strategy.

2. British Free-Trade Advocacy in Colonial and Semi-Colonial Contexts
    - India and the dismantling of indigenous manufacturing.
    - Asymmetrical application of “free markets” doctrine.
    - Ideology as a stabilizer of imperial productive hierarchies.

3. German Historical School vs. Classical Economics

    - Friedrich List and the critique of abstract universalism.
    - Emergence of stage-based and nation-specific development discourse.
    - Competing epistemic foundations within economics itself.

4. Neoliberal Policy Diffusion (1970s–1990s)

    - Chicago School economists and Latin America.
    - IMF and World Bank conditionality.
    - Policy transfer under crisis conditions.
    - Discursive framing of “no alternative.”

5. East Asian Developmental States

    - Selective adoption and rejection of orthodox economic advice.
    - Bureaucratic insulation and experimental policy learning.
    - Ideology subordinated to performance metrics.

6. Post-Soviet Transition Economies

    - Shock therapy as an exported ideological package.
    - Interaction between imported discourse and weak institutional capacity.
    - Divergent outcomes despite similar advice.

## Against Conspiratorial Interpretations

- Social and economic reality is complex, adaptive, and emergent.
- Economic ideologies do not require centralized planning or a “mastermind” to arise.
- Coherent doctrines can emerge from:
  - Repeated interaction among heterogeneous agents.
  - Institutional selection pressures.
  - Professional incentives within epistemic communities.
  - Retrospective rationalization of successful practices.
- Power operates through structural alignment and reinforcement, not necessarily explicit coordination.
- Ideological dominance is often an emergent equilibrium, not a designed outcome.
