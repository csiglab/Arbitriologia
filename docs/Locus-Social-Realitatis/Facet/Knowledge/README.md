# Knowledge System

> **Note**: `Knowledge = { Technology, Knowhow, Knowwhat }`.

> **Note**: Units are represented here as types or categories, not as specific instances.

QA:

- How can we develop an industry- or cluster-specific version of the system?
- How can we incentivize the inflow of new technical knowledge into the country?
- How can we become more market-oriented and create strong incentives for high-quality teaching and excellence?

## Introduction

> ...

### Knowledge

- First Order Knowledge (Tacit Technical Knowledge)
- Second Order Knowledge (How to Create New Technical Knowledge)
- Other Types of Knowledge

### Cognitive Store

- to a Human
- to a Enterprise
- to a Institution

### Enterprise as a Subject

- Industrial Training
- Business Mentorship
- External Commerce Training
- [Protofábrica] Technology Demostration Center: Pilot Plants (Example Enterprises); Pilot Projects + Technology Exposition Center - Hey; Let See Examples; Quality Assurance
  - AgResearch
  - Process Innovation
  - Agricultural Pilot Projects

### Innovation

1. Process innovation: the best of Indian industry is world-class in process innovation. For example: our airlines, hospitals, retail and financial services are excellent. We have to adopt process innovations in smaller and mid-sized companies. Overall I will give ourselves 70% on this.
2. Product innovation: I would give ourselves barely passing marks, about 35% and that might even be optimistic. Innovations like UPI show we *can* do it, but there is still so much work to do. Our industry needs product people (envisioning new trains and new train lines) in addition to effective project managers (running the trains on time).
3. Technology innovation: Today we export most of our technology innovation talent. We have to first retain that talent and that talent will only stay if they have challenging opportunities. We can also attract talent back if we create and fund ambitious projects.

## Parts

- **Knowledge Production**: The creation of new knowledge through systematic research, experimentation, and inquiry.
- **Technical Improvement**: ...
- **Knowledge Diffusion**: The process of transmitting, sharing, and disseminating knowledge to users, stakeholders, and communities.
- **Knowledge Utilization**: The effective application and integration of knowledge in practical contexts, decision-making, and innovation.
- **Knowledge Preservation**: The systematic storage, archiving, and safeguarding of knowledge to ensure its availability for future use.
- **Knowledge Feedback**: Mechanisms for evaluating, refining, and updating knowledge based on user experience, outcomes, and new evidence.
- **Technical Knowledge Indigenization**: The adaptation and transformation of imported technical knowledge to fit local cultural, environmental, and economic contexts.
- **Technical Knowledge Adoption & Utilization**: The process by which technical knowledge is accepted, implemented, and leveraged for productive outcomes.
