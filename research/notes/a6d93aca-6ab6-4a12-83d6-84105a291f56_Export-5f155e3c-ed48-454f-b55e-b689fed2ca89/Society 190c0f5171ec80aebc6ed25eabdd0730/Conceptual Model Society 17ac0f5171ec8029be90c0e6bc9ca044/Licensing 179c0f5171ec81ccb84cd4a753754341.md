> The **IP (Intellectual Property) Licensing business model** involves granting permission to third parties to use intellectual property (e.g., patents, trademarks, copyrights, or trade secrets) in exchange for **royalties** or **licensing fees**. This model allows IP owners to monetize their creations without directly manufacturing or selling products.
