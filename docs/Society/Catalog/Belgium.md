# A Guide to Profile a Country  
> This guide provides a structured framework for developing in-depth country profiles, with a focus on the institutional, historical, and sectoral dimensions of national economic development. It is designed for researchers, analysts, policy practitioners, and students who seek to understand not just what a country produces, but how and through which institutions, policies, and historical pathways it came to do so.
