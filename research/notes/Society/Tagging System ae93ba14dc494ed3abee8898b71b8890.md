# Tagging System

: 14

> A **tagging system** is a method for organizing and categorizing information by assigning descriptive keywords or tags to data.
> 

> **Tag Management**: This involves creating, updating, and deleting tags to keep the system organized and relevant. Tag management ensures that tags are consistent and useful.
> 

> **Categories or Hierarchies**: Tags can be organized into broader categories or hierarchical structures to provide more context and improve searchability. For example, “Energy Research” could be a main category with sub-tags like “Renewable Energy” and “Energy Policy.”

ML Methods

- Classification Models: Use models like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Deep Learning models to predict tags based on features of the items.
- Text Classification: For text data, use algorithms like Naive Bayes, Random Forests, or advanced methods like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for semantic understanding.
- Clustering Algorithms: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN to group similar items, then manually or semi-automatically assign tags to clusters.
- Topic Modeling: Use methods like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover topics in documents and generate relevant tags.
