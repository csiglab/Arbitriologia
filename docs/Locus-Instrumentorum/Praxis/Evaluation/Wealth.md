## Case Study

### Australia

> How to think about wealth?

> How should we think about wealth in resource-rich countries?

> How to reason about Australia’s export performance and well-being?

> What are the effects of foreign ownership of resources on national wealth retention?

> What are the mechanisms for managing commodity price volatility and economic shocks?

> How does Australia’s wealth compare to other resource-rich countries (e.g., Chile, Norway)?

> How should we think about decreasing returns in resource-based economies? How should we think about growth in resource based economies?

#### How has Australia managed to accumulate significant national wealth despite its continued reliance on the export of largely unprocessed natural resources like iron ore and coal?

> ...

#### What fiscal, regulatory, and institutional mechanisms has Australia used to ensure that a meaningful share of mining and energy sector profits benefits the public sector and national development?

| **Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)** | Foreign firms invest in Australian businesses (especially mining and real estate), bringing in capital.                                          |
| **Portfolio Investment**            | Global investors purchase Australian stocks, bonds, and property, resulting in foreign capital inflows.                                          |
