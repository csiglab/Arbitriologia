## Cognitive Structure

| Epistemological Element | Description | Cognitive Role(s) |
|------------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Sensory Input | Raw data received from the environment through senses | Foundation for all perception and knowledge acquisition |
| Human Cognition | Overall process of acquiring and processing knowledge | Integrates inputs and manages reasoning, memory, and decision-making |
| Epistemological Principle | Fundamental rules or axioms governing knowledge acquisition | Basis for justification and validation of knowledge claims |
| Belief | Cognitive states representing acceptance of propositions | Drives interpretation and action based on knowledge |
| Perception | Interpretation of sensory input into meaningful experience | Enables awareness and recognition of external stimuli |
| Attention | Cognitive focus on particular stimuli or information | Filters and prioritizes information processing |
| Expectation | Anticipation based on prior knowledge or experience | Guides perception and inference by predicting outcomes |
| Memory | Storage and retrieval of past experiences and knowledge | Supports learning, recognition, and informed decision-making |
| Uncertainty | State of incomplete or imprecise knowledge | Motivates further inquiry and risk assessment |
| Risk | Quantifiable potential for loss or adverse outcomes | Influences decision-making under uncertainty |
| Inference | Logical reasoning process to derive conclusions | Enables extending knowledge beyond direct observation |
| Heuristic | Mental shortcuts or rules of thumb used for problem-solving | Facilitates efficient but approximate decision-making |
| Interpretation | Assigning meaning or significance to information | Critical for understanding and communication |
| Idea | Mental representation or notion | Basic unit of thought and creativity |
| Concept | Abstract category or class of related ideas | Organizes knowledge into meaningful structures |
| Mental Model | Internal representation of how a system or reality works | Enables prediction, explanation, and problem-solving |
| Bias | Systematic deviation from rational judgment | Influences perception and decisions, often unconsciously |
| Cognitive Schema | Frameworks that organize and interpret information | Helps structure knowledge and expectations |
| Ideology | Set of beliefs and values shaping worldview | Provides interpretive lens influencing cognition and behavior |
| Decision Model | Cognitive process or framework guiding choices | Structures evaluation of options and selection of actions |
| Cognitive Framework | Structured system of principles, schemas, and models that organizes cognitive processes | Provides foundational architecture for knowledge integration; supports complex reasoning and metacognition |
| Cognitive Tool | Specific method or strategy employed to enhance cognitive performance | Optimizes information processing; enables efficient problem-solving and knowledge application |
| Metacognition| Awareness and regulation of one's own cognitive processes | Enables self-monitoring, strategic learning, and adaptive control of cognition |
