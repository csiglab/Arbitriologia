# Economic Thought

> Look **economic thought**; does not have to be written is can also be  “Venetian Mercantilism was not written” was not wrriten; the thought can be practice without being written;

> **Economic thought** does not have to be written. It can be embodied in practice, institutional behavior, state policies, guild rules, trade patterns — all without formal theory.

## Classical Economics

- Key idea: Markets tend toward equilibrium through price adjustments.

- Modeling focus: Supply and demand curves, rational agents, and long-run full employment.

- Typical tools: Static comparative statics, aggregate production functions.

- Examples: Say’s Law, labor market equilibrium models.

## Neoclassical Economics

- Key idea: Agents maximize utility or profits with rational expectations; markets clear.

- Modeling focus: Optimization, equilibrium analysis, perfect competition.

- Tools: Microeconomic foundations, constrained optimization (Lagrangians), general equilibrium models.

- Applications: Consumer theory, firm theory, general equilibrium.

## Keynesian Economics

- Key idea: Markets can fail to clear; economies may have persistent unemployment.

- Modeling focus: Aggregate demand-driven fluctuations, sticky prices and wages.

- Tools: IS-LM models, aggregate demand and supply curves, multiplier effects.

- Variants: New Keynesian models incorporate microfoundations and rational expectations but keep market imperfections.

## New Classical Economics

- Key idea: Rational expectations and market clearing are central; prices adjust instantly.

- Modeling focus: Policy ineffectiveness and natural rate hypothesis.

- Tools: Real Business Cycle (RBC) models, dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE).

- Characteristics: Emphasizes technology shocks, no money illusion.

## New Keynesian Economics

- Key idea: Combines rational expectations with price and wage stickiness.

- Modeling focus: Microfounded models with frictions causing market imperfections.

- Tools: DSGE with nominal rigidities, menu costs, imperfect competition.

- Use: Central banks’ monetary policy analysis.

## Behavioral Economics

- Key idea: Real agents deviate from perfect rationality due to cognitive biases.

- Modeling focus: Incorporating psychology into economic decisions.

- Tools: Prospect theory, bounded rationality models, experimental economics.

- Applications: Consumer behavior, market anomalies, policy design.

## Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)

- Key idea: Economy as a complex adaptive system with heterogeneous interacting agents.

- Modeling focus: Bottom-up simulation rather than closed-form equilibrium.

- Tools: Computational simulations, cellular automata, network models.

- Strength: Captures emergent phenomena, non-equilibrium dynamics.

## Evolutionary Economics

- Key idea: Economic processes evolve like biological systems with innovation and selection.

- Modeling focus: Dynamic processes, innovation diffusion, path dependence.

- Tools: Replicator dynamics, evolutionary game theory.

- Emphasis: Processes rather than static equilibria.

## Post-Keynesian Economics

- Key idea: Emphasizes uncertainty, institutions, and fundamental disequilibrium.

- Modeling focus: Endogenous money, demand-led growth, financial instability.

- Tools: Stock-flow consistent models, Kaleckian growth models.

- Difference: Rejects some neoclassical assumptions on equilibrium.

## Institutional Economics

- Key idea: Institutions shape economic behavior and outcomes.

- Modeling focus: Role of rules, laws, social norms in shaping incentives.

- Tools: Historical analysis, qualitative models, some formal game theory.

- Application: Development economics, law and economics.

## Input-Output Models

- Key idea: Economy as interlinked sectors with flows of goods and services.

- Modeling focus: Quantitative sectoral interdependencies.

- Tools: Leontief input-output tables and linear algebra.

- Use: Planning, impact analysis, environmental economics.

## Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Models

- Key idea: Calibrated general equilibrium models for policy simulation.

- Modeling focus: Market-clearing with multiple sectors, agents, and policies.

- Tools: Numerical computation, calibration to data.

- Applications: Trade policy, tax policy, climate change economics.

## Structural Econometric Models

- Key idea: Micro-founded models with statistical estimation to identify parameters.

- Modeling focus: Test theories against data, causal inference.

- Tools: Econometric methods, instrumental variables, maximum likelihood.

- Application: Labor economics, industrial organization.

## Financial Economics Models

- Key idea: Pricing assets and understanding financial markets under uncertainty.

- Modeling focus: No-arbitrage, risk-neutral valuation, portfolio choice.

- Tools: Stochastic calculus, option pricing models, CAPM.

- Examples: Black-Scholes, binomial models.

## Econometrics

- Key idea: The quantitative study of economic phenomena using statistical and mathematical methods.

- Modeling focus: Estimating relationships between economic variables, hypothesis testing, forecasting.

- Tools: Regression analysis, time series models, panel data models, instrumental variables, causal inference techniques.

- Purpose: To validate economic theories with real-world data and measure economic relationships.

- Applications: Policy evaluation, forecasting GDP, unemployment analysis, demand estimation.

## Complexity Economics

- Key idea: Economy as a complex adaptive system with many interacting heterogeneous agents leading to emergent behavior.

- Modeling focus: Non-equilibrium dynamics, network effects, path dependence, feedback loops.

- Tools: Agent-based models, network theory, nonlinear dynamics, simulation techniques.

- Distinguishing feature: Rejects the assumption of equilibrium; emphasizes adaptation and evolution over time.

- Applications: Financial market dynamics, innovation diffusion, systemic risk, economic crises.

## Experimental Economics

- Key idea: Testing economic theories through controlled laboratory experiments.

- Modeling focus: Human decision-making under controlled settings, market experiments.

- Tools: Laboratory setups, behavioral game theory.

- Purpose: To observe actual behavior versus theoretical predictions.

- Applications: Auction design, public goods games, bargaining behavior.

## Game Theory

- Key idea: Study of strategic interaction among rational decision-makers.

- Modeling focus: Modeling competition and cooperation using payoff matrices and equilibrium concepts.

- Tools: Nash equilibrium, evolutionary game theory, repeated games, Bayesian games.

- Applications: Oligopoly markets, bargaining, contract theory, auctions.

## Network Economics

- Key idea: Economic interactions take place over networks (social, trade, financial).

- Modeling focus: How network structure affects outcomes like diffusion, contagion, and bargaining power.

- Tools: Graph theory, network formation models, contagion models.

- Applications: Financial contagion, innovation spread, supply chain analysis.

## Structural Economics

- Key idea: Focuses on the role of large-scale structural features and constraints of the economy—such as institutions, social classes, and production relations—in shaping economic outcomes.

- Modeling focus: The deep, systemic organization of the economy rather than surface-level market interactions; explains persistent inequalities and development patterns.

- Tools: Qualitative and quantitative analysis; often uses input-output tables, sectoral analysis, historical institutional analysis, and multi-sector general equilibrium models.

- Distinguishing feature: Emphasizes that economic phenomena arise from the structure and organization of the economy rather than just individual agents' choices or market equilibria.

- Applications: Development economics, structural change, industrial policy, income distribution, long-run growth patterns.

## Causality

- **Key idea**: Understanding and identifying cause-and-effect relationships between economic variables rather than mere correlations.
- **Modeling focus**: Establishing the direction and magnitude of causal impacts for policy evaluation, forecasting, and theory testing.
- **Tools and methods**:
  - **Econometric techniques**: Instrumental  variables (IV), difference-in-differences (DiD), regression discontinuity design (RDD), propensity score matching.
  - **Structural causal models**: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), potential outcomes framework.
  - **Natural experiments**: Exploit exogenous variation to infer causality.
  - **Counterfactual analysis**: Assessing what would happen under alternative scenarios.
- **Importance**: Crucial for credible policy analysis and understanding mechanisms behind economic phenomena.
- **Applications**: Evaluating the effect of education on earnings, tax policy impacts, labor market interventions, health economics.
