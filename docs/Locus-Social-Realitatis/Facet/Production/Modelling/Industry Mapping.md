- **Knowledge Transfer**: Identify how knowledge, skills, and technologies flow across the ecosystem. This could involve research institutions, training programs, innovation hubs, and partnerships.
- **Technological Landscape**: Identifying the technologies being utilized, developed, or innovated within the industry. This can include current industry technologies, emerging technologies, and trends like automation, digitalization, and sustainability efforts.
- **Competitive Landscape**: Analyzing the competitive dynamics within the industry, such as market share distribution, strategic positioning, competitive advantages, and barriers to entry. This includes the identification of market leaders, challengers, and potential disruptors.
