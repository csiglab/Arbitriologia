| **Monetary Model** | **Description** | **Notable Contributors** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Quantity Theory of Money** | States that the general price level of goods and services is directly proportional to the amount of money in circulation. | Milton Friedman, Irving Fisher |
| **Keynesian Model** | Emphasizes the role of aggregate demand in influencing economic output and inflation, with active government intervention. | John Maynard Keynes |
| **Monetarist Model** | Focuses on the long-term relationship between the money supply and price levels, advocating for controlling the money supply. | Milton Friedman |
| **New Classical Model** | Based on rational expectations and market-clearing, where people use all available information to form expectations about economic variables. | Robert Lucas, Thomas Sargent |
| **New Keynesian Model** | Incorporates sticky prices and wages into the Keynesian framework, explaining short-term economic fluctuations and the effects of monetary policy. | Greg Mankiw, Michael Woodford |
| **IS-LM Model** | Analyzes the relationship between interest rates (I), savings (S), liquidity preference (L), and money supply (M), used to understand equilibrium in the goods and money markets. | John Hicks, Alvin Hansen |
| **Fisher Equation** | Relates nominal interest rates to real interest rates and expected inflation, showing how inflation expectations influence interest rates. | Irving Fisher |
| **Taylor Rule** | Provides a formula for setting interest rates based on economic conditions, particularly the inflation rate and the output gap. | John B. Taylor |
| **Real Business Cycle Model** | Emphasizes real (rather than monetary) shocks to the economy, such as changes in technology or productivity, and their impact on economic cycles. | Finn E. Kydland, Edward C. Prescott |
| **Overlapping Generations Model** | Studies the interactions between different generations within an economy, often used to analyze issues like social security and public debt. | Paul Samuelson, Peter Diamond |
| **Credit Channel Model** | Focuses on how changes in credit conditions (availability of loans, interest rates) impact economic activity and monetary policy effectiveness. | Ben Bernanke, Mark Gertler |
| **Endogenous Money Theory** | Proposes that money supply is determined by the demand for loans, implying that central banks accommodate the money supply to meet economic needs. | Basil Moore, Hyman Minsky |

Challenges and responsibilities:

1. **Trade Imbalances:** The dollar’s global dominance can cause trade imbalances as countries stockpile reserves.
2. **Dependency:** Reliance on the U.S. dollar reduces other nations’ economic sovereignty.
3. **Exchange Rate Risks:** Holding large dollar reserves exposes countries to currency fluctuations.
4. **Risk of Depreciation:** A loss of global confidence in the dollar could weaken its value and impact the U.S. economy.
