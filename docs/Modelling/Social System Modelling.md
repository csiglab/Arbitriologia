# Social System Modelling

> A complete model of a social system must include representation of entities, interaction and feedback between them, and adaptation over time, all within the context of structures, environments, and historical dynamics.
## Core

| **Component**                 | **Description**                                                                                 | **Example**                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Representation**         | How entities (agents, institutions, rules, values) are modeled and structured                   | Agents, roles, groups, norms, material artifacts              |
| **Interaction & Feedback** | How entities influence one another; includes communication, coordination, power, conflict       | Norm enforcement, markets, social pressure, feedback loops    |
| **Adaptation & Learning**  | How entities or the system change over time in response to internal/external pressures          | Policy reform, norm change, identity shift                    |
| **Structure & Constraint** | Formal/informal systems that stabilize or limit behavior (institutions, hierarchies, resources) | Legal systems, social stratification, material infrastructure |
| **Environment & Boundary** | The external systems or conditions the social system is embedded within and responds to         | Ecology, technological systems, geopolitics                   |
| **Temporality & History**  | Path-dependence, memory, transitions, cycles, and accumulation over time                        | Legacy systems, traditions, historical trauma, reforms        |

## Model Structure

| **Component**                | **Purpose**                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ontology**                 | Define entities and categories clearly (e.g., what counts as an agent, institution, artifact). |
| **Interaction Rules**        | Specify how agents interact with one another and with structures.                              |
| **Temporal Mechanics**       | Allow for change, feedback, emergence, and memory/history.                                     |
| **Boundary Mechanisms**      | Define how the system interfaces with other systems and environments.                          |
| **Multi-level Architecture** | Account for micro (individual), meso (group/org), and macro (institution/systemic) dynamics.   |
| **Heterogeneity**            | Allow for variation across agents, norms, structures, and geographies.                         |
| **Representation of Power**  | Capture how differentials in power shape outcomes and enable/disable change.                   |
