# Ontic Representation

> Reality is the totality of extra-mental elements that exist independently of any observer. It includes objects, events, processes, and structures that can, in principle, be perceived, measured, or modeled.

## Indirection

- **Reality Indirection**: The degree of mediation between phenomena in the world and our ability to access or interact with them.
- **Mental Indirection**: The degree of mediation between external reality and the mind’s representation of it. Concepts, categories, and models do not replicate reality exactly—they abstract, simplify, and structure phenomena to facilitate understanding.

## Reality Indirection

> Let’s explore some key indirections within the social sphere.

| Indirection          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Ontic Characterization                                                                                                       |

| **Social Structure** | Patterns of relationships, roles, and institutions that mediate individual behavior and collective phenomena.                                                                                                            | **Emergent-relational** — arises from aggregated interactions but acquires autonomous, constraining properties.              |
| **Power**            | A relational capacity that mediates influence, control, and the distribution of possibilities among actors. Operates both directly (in interactions) and indirectly (through institutions, norms, and symbolic systems). | **Relational-abstract** — grounded in concrete relations yet stabilized through abstract systemic patterns.                  |
| **Class**            | A structural differentiation based on unequal access to resources, capital, and opportunities. Mediates life chances and the distribution of influence in society.                                                       | **Structural-positional** — constituted by positions within systems of production and exchange; persists beyond individuals. |
| **Agency**           | The capacity of actors to make choices and enact change within structural and institutional constraints.                                                                                                                 | **Individual-relational** — rooted in actors but shaped and limited by systemic patterns and norms.                          |
| **System**           | Interconnected networks of agents, roles, and institutions forming organized social wholes.                                                                                                                              | **Holistic-dynamic** — composed of interacting components whose behavior cannot be reduced to individual elements.           |
| **Institution**      | Established rules, norms, and practices that stabilize social interactions and reproduce structures over time.                                                                                                           | **Stabilizing-structural** — maintains continuity and predictability in social processes.                                    |
| **Social Relation**  | Patterned interactions between actors, including cooperation, conflict, and dependency.                                                                                                                                  | **Relational-processual** — emerges from interactions but can acquire durability and systemic influence.                     |
| **Discourse**        | Systems of statements, narratives, and meanings that shape perception, action, and social organization.                                                                                                                  | **Symbolic-structural** — both cognitive and social; stabilizes norms and power relations.                                   |
| **Ideology**         | Structured set of beliefs and values that naturalizes or legitimizes specific social arrangements and power structures.                                                                                                  | **Normative-symbolic** — mediates understanding and acceptance of social hierarchies and institutional arrangements.         |
| **Myth**             | Foundational narrative or story that legitimizes social norms, institutions, or collective identities.                                                                                                                   | **Narrative-symbolic** — persists over time, shaping collective meaning and guiding expectations.                            |
| **Stratification**   | Vertical differentiation of social positions and roles based on access to resources, prestige, and power.                                                                                                                | **Positional-structural** — emerges from systemic relations and resource distribution; constrains opportunities.             |
