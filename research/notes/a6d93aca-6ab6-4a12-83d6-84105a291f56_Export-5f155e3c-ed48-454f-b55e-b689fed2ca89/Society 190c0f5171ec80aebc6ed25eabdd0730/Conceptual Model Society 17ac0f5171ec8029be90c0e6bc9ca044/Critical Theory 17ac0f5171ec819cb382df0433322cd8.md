## Critical Theory

> A **critical theory** is any approach to [humanities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities) and [social philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_philosophy) that focuses on society and culture to attempt to reveal, critique, and challenge [power structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_structure). With roots in [sociology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology) and [literary criticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_criticism), it argues that [social problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_problems) stem more from [social structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_structure) and [cultural assumptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assumptions) rather than from individuals. Some hold it to be an ideology, others argue that [ideology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology) is the principal obstacle to human liberation.
