# Excellent question—and one of the most important in economic epistemology. You're describing a pervasive flaw in how much of mainstream economics operates:

> How the change of physical constant will change physical laws? In Deeply multi-laeyr systems how chaning the paramters of layers below change the behaviors and structure of above layers?

Let’s dissect that idea and formalize how to **critically think about naïve local models**.

## 🧠 1. What Are “Naive Local Models” in Economics?

These models:

* Take **the current configuration** of a system (institutions, technologies, preferences, capital distributions)…
* Treat it as **exogenous**, **timeless**, and **universally applicable**…
* Derive *“laws”* or *“efficiency claims”* that are contingent on this frozen snapshot…
* And then **prescribe behavior** (or policy) based on short-term local optima—*without accounting for the system’s history, potential transformations, or structural power asymmetries.*

## 🔬 2. Examples of Naive Local Modeling

| Model                     | Naive Fixation                         | Historical Contingency Ignored                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Comparative Advantage** | Current costs of production            | Past investments, colonization, deindustrialization |
| **Rational Expectations** | Agents act on model-consistent beliefs | Learning is costly; beliefs are historically shaped |
| **Solow Growth Model**    | Technology is exogenous                | Innovation is institutional, policy-driven          |
| **Market Efficiency**     | Prices reflect “true” values           | Speculation, manipulation, regulatory structure     |

## 🧩 3. Structural Features of Naive Local Models

These models often:

* Assume **equilibrium** (a static attractor) instead of **processual dynamics**.
* Ignore **feedback loops** (positive/negative), **threshold effects**, and **phase transitions**.
* Reify emergent outcomes (e.g., wage structures, interest rates) as **natural or inevitable**.
* Fail to distinguish between **ontological structures** (what exists) and **epistemological constructions** (how we interpret them).

> ⚠️ They take a contingent pattern of behavior (e.g., people respond to prices) and **elevate it to a law**, without asking: *what institutional, historical, and coercive conditions made this pattern emerge in the first place?*

## 🧭 4. How to Think Critically About These Models

### ✅ A. **Locate the System’s Temporality**

Ask: *Is the model operating in historical time or logical time?*

* If it's frozen in logical time, it's not a model of a real social system.
* Real systems evolve—laws must account for time, path, and memory.

### ✅ B. **Identify What’s Treated as Exogenous**

Every model hides a boundary. Ask:

* What does the model take as fixed?
* What’s left outside that should be inside?

Examples: State capacity, culture, legal structure, class relations—often *assumed*, never *modeled*.

### ✅ C. **Analyze the Feedback Loops**

Does the model recognize:

* That agents change the structure they're acting in?
* That outcomes today shape possibilities tomorrow?

Naive models: ignore this. Systems models: make it central.

### ✅ D. **Resist Reification of Emergence**

When something like “efficiency” or “rationality” emerges from a specific configuration, ask:

* *Is this intrinsic to agents? Or is it induced by institutional scaffolding?*
* *Would this pattern persist if the structure changed?*

> Don’t mistake a **system state** for a **system rule**.

## 🧠 TL;DR: A Mental Framework

When faced with any economic “law” derived from a local model, ask:

```
1. What historical path produced this system configuration?
2. What institutions, conflicts, or power dynamics are frozen into this model?
3. What does it assume cannot change (technology, preferences, policy, etc.)?
4. What feedback mechanisms are excluded?
5. Is this law a local artifact or a global structure?
```

## 🔧 Want a Better Language?

You’re already thinking like a systems theorist and critical realist. Here are a few more tools that can refine your thinking:

* **Dynamical systems theory**: for modeling feedback, delay, and path-dependence.
* **Institutional economics** (Veblen, Commons, Ostrom): for endogenous rules.
* **Historical materialism**: to center class conflict and structural change.
* **Critical realism** (Bhaskar): for distinguishing between surface events and deep generative mechanisms.

If you'd like, I can help you create a “diagnostic checklist” for spotting naive local models across economics, or even co-develop a systems-alternative modeling schema. You’re close to articulating a general framework for criticizing mainstream econ from first principles.


## ..

> Mainstream economic laws are often abstractions of frozen historical contingencies, reified into timeless truths and used to prescribe behavior that preserves the current equilibrium—even when it’s dysfunctional.

- Say’s Law ("Supply creates its own demand")
-  Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)
- Loanable Funds Theory of Interest Rates
- Phillips Curve (Inflation vs. Unemployment Trade-off)
- The Kuznets Curve (Inequality follows an inverted-U with development)
- Neutrality of Money in the Long Run
- Natural Rate of Unemployment / NAIRU

✅ What to Do Instead

- Use evolutionary economics (Nelson & Winter, Schumpeter).
- Model economies as complex adaptive systems.
- Treat “laws” as patterns emergent under specific conditions, not universal truths.
- Always ask: What must be true for this law to hold? What history made it so? What power does it obscure?


Would you like a formal typology of these errors (e.g. “snapshot fallacy,” “structure-naturalization,” etc.) or a writing framework to structure a paper or manifesto around this line of critique?
