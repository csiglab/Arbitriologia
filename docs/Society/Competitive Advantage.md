# Competitive Advantage

> The Diamond Model of Competition, also known as the Porter Diamond Model, is an economic framework developed by Harvard economist Michael Porter to explain why some countries or regions are more competitive than others in certain industries.

> The Diamond Model models the comparative advantage of nations.

The **Diamond Model** consists of four key components:

- **Factor Conditions**: This refers to the inputs required for production, such as natural resources, labor, capital, infrastructure, and technology. A nation or region with favorable factor conditions will have a competitive advantage in industries that rely heavily on those inputs.
- **Demand Conditions**: The level and nature of demand for a particular product or service within a nation can drive innovation, productivity, and quality. Industries in nations with sophisticated and demanding customers will likely be more competitive.
- **Related and Supporting Industries**: The presence of related and supporting industries can create advantages for the industry. For example, a cluster of suppliers, service providers, and skilled labor in a particular geographic area can enhance an industry’s competitiveness.
- **Firm Strategy, Structure, and Rivalry**: The intensity of competition in industry within a nation, as well as the presence of innovative and aggressive firms, can drive productivity, innovation, and global competitiveness.

The **Diamond Model** suggests that these four components are interconnected and mutually reinforcing and that a nation can build a competitive advantage by developing and optimizing these factors. It is a helpful framework for policymakers and businesses to understand the sources of competitive advantage in their respective nations and industries.

## Modeling Competition

> What data is needed to make a model of competitiveness? What is competitiveness? What is the competition?

Michael Porter’s Five Forces model is a framework that helps businesses understand the competitiveness of their industry and develop strategies to stay competitive. The Five Forces model identifies five competitive forces that shape the industry and affect the potential profitability of a business:

- The **threat of new entrants** refers to how easy or difficult it is for new competitors to enter the industry. If barriers to entry are high, such as high start-up costs or strict regulations, then the threat of new entrants is low, and existing businesses have more power.
- The **bargaining power of suppliers** refers to the degree of control suppliers have over the price and quality of inputs. If there are few suppliers or the inputs are unique, suppliers have more bargaining power.
- The **bargaining power of buyers** refers to the degree of control buyers have over the price and quality of outputs. If there are few buyers or the outputs are unique, buyers have more bargaining power.
- The **threat of substitute products or services** refers to the degree to which other products or services can substitute for the one offered. If there are many substitutes available, then the threat is high.
- The **intensity of competitive rivalry** refers to the degree of competition among existing businesses in the industry. If many businesses are competing fiercely, then the intensity of rivalry is high.

By analyzing these five forces, businesses can identify the key drivers of competition in their industry and develop strategies to stay competitive.

**Origins of the Model**

Michael Porter developed his Five Forces model based on extensive research on competition and industry analysis. He drew on various sources, including economic theory, case studies, and empirical research.

One of the critical sources for his model was the work of economists such as Joseph Schumpeter and Edward Chamberlin, who had developed theories about market structure and competition in the early 20th century. Porter also drew on the work of industrial organization economists such as John Bain and George Stigler, who had conducted empirical studies of market structure and performance.

In addition, Porter conducted extensive case studies of various industries, including the airline, banking, and automobile industries, to understand the competitive forces at work in those industries. He also analyzed data on industry structure, market share, and profitability to test his hypotheses about the determinants of competition.

Overall, Porter’s Five Forces model was developed through a combination of theoretical insights, empirical research, and case studies and has been widely applied in academia and business practice to understand and analyze competitive dynamics in various industries.
