# Behavior

> Behavior is the observable expression of an entityâ€™s internal dispositions as it interacts with its environment over time. It reflects the structured sequence of actions or responses performed by an interaction unit in relation to stimuli, goals, norms, and constraints.

## Signature

> Note: While behavior can be modeled as an external process, in this framework we treat behavior as the internal dispositional structure of an agent that governs how it responds to stimuli and makes decisions.

| **Aspect**              | **Description**                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**                | Dispositional Process                                                                                 |
| **Bearer**              | Interaction Unit (e.g., individual, group, organization)                                              |
| **Temporality**         | Temporally extended; behavior unfolds across time as a patterned process                              |
| **Context-Sensitivity** | Behavior adapts to external stimuli, internal states, and regulatory conditions                       |
| **Relation to Norms**   | Can conform to, deviate from, or challenge shared regulations and cultural scripts                    |
| **Observation Level**   | Can be analyzed at micro (individual), meso (group), or macro (system) levels                         |
| **Ontological Role**    | Connects internal state (e.g., preferences, beliefs) with external phenomena (e.g., outcomes, events) |
