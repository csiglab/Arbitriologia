# Trompenaars's Model of National Culture Differences

> …
> 

Trompenaars' model of national culture differences is a framework for understanding cultural diversity across different countries and societies. It was developed by Dutch researcher Fons Trompenaars and British anthropologist Charles Hampden-Turner in their book "Riding the Waves of Culture: Understanding Cultural Diversity in Business" (1997).

This model is often categorized as a cultural dimensions framework, similar to Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory. Trompenaars' model identifies several dimensions along which cultures can differ, providing a structured way to analyze and compare cultural values and behaviors across societies. The model originally included seven dimensions, later expanded to include more.

The original seven dimensions proposed by Trompenaars are:

1. **Universalism vs. Particularism**: Deals with the extent to which rules and standards are universally applied versus adapted to individual circumstances.
2. **Individualism vs. Collectivism**: Examines the degree of emphasis on individual interests and autonomy versus group cohesion and collective goals.
3. **Neutral vs. Emotional**: Explores the expression of emotions and the acceptance of emotional displays in social interactions.
4. **Specific vs. Diffuse**: Considers the boundaries of personal and professional relationships and the extent to which they overlap.
5. **Achievement vs. Ascription**: Addresses the criteria for assigning status and respect, whether based on achievements or inherited characteristics such as age, gender, or social class.
6. **Sequential Time vs. Synchronous Time**: Reflects attitudes toward time management and scheduling, distinguishing between linear, punctual time orientations and more fluid, flexible approaches to time.
7. **Internal Direction vs. External Direction**: Examines the locus of control and responsibility, whether individuals are more inclined to prioritize personal goals and values or conform to external expectations and authority.

Each dimension represents a spectrum along which cultures can vary, and the positioning of a particular culture along these dimensions helps in understanding its unique cultural characteristics and preferences. Trompenaars' model provides insights into how cultural differences may impact various aspects of social interaction, communication, and business practices, making it a valuable tool for cross-cultural management and international business.

## Passenger’s Dilemma

My favorite behavioral experiment covered in The WEIRDest People in the World:

“You are riding in a car driven by a close friend. He hits a pedestrian. You know that he was going at least 35 mph in an area of the city where the maximum allowed speed is 20 mph. There are no witnesses, except for you. His lawyer says that if you testify under oath that he was driving only 20 mph, it may save him from serious legal consequences.

Do you think:

1.  that your friend has a definite right to expect you to testify (as his close friend), and that you would testify that he was going 20 mph OR
2.  that your friend has little or no right to expect you to testify and that you would not falsely testify that he was only going 20 mph?"
...

Below is an explanation by the author the book, Joseph Henrich, and a graphical depiction of the responses found in the underlying study.

“If you picked response (b), you’re probably pretty WEIRD, like people in Canada, Switzerland, and the United States, where more than 90 percent of participants prefer not to testify and don’t think their friend has any right to expect such a thing. This is the universalistic or nonrelational response. By contrast, in Nepal, Venezuela, and South Korea, most people said they’d willingly lie under oath to help a close friend. This is the particularistic or relational response, which captures people’s loyalty to their family and friends.”

“There’s nothing special about the content of the Passenger’s Dilemma. In places where people would help their friends by testifying, they also report a willingness to (1) give their friends insider company information, (2) lie about a friend’s medical exam to lower his insurance rates, and (3) exaggerate the quality of the cuisine at a friend’s restaurant in a published review. In these places, the “right” answer is to help your friend. People aren’t trying to distinguish themselves as relentlessly honest individuals governed by impartial principles. Instead, they are deeply loyal to their friends and want to cement enduring relationships, even if this involves illegal actions. In these places, being nepotistic is often the morally correct thing to do. By contrast, in WEIRD societies, many people think badly of those who weight family and friends over impartial principles and anonymous criteria like qualifications, merit, or effort.”
