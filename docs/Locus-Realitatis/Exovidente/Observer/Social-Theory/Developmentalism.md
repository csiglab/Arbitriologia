# Developmentalism

> Note: Assume the position of an external observer.

> Developmentalism is an epistemological lens with ontological consequences.
It observes the world in a certain way — and by doing so, it helps create institutions that make that world real.

> An observer’s epistemological framework that generates a specific ontological configuration and dynamics.

> Developmentalism, in its most abstract form, is the belief that political actors can deliberately reshape the social and material conditions of their society through coordinated, long-term effort, typically by mobilizing state power, organizing production, and controlling resources. This schema predates capitalism, modernity, and even the nation-state.

> Developmentalism is a cognitive schema that interprets national progress as a structured, stage-based, and attainable transformation, wherein states and societies are viewed as capable of purposeful ascent through coordinated institutional effort.

> **Development** is the dialectical process through which a system (society, polity, or economy) realizes its inherent potential by navigating and resolving internal contradictions. It unfolds as a negation of negation — overcoming previous states (thesis and antithesis) to reach higher levels of complexity and self-awareness. Development is thus not linear or static, but a dynamic movement of becoming, where each stage preserves and transcends what came before, manifesting the system’s self-realization and actualization over time. - [Check This]

## Epistemological Signature

> Developmentalism is a framework of observation and interpretation — a way of seeing and making sense of national and economic progress.

> It acts like an observer or lens, shaping how we understand causality, progress, backwardness, modernity, and transformation.

> Developmentalism is also a cognitive schema — a way of perceiving and interpreting a country’s position in global hierarchies and its capacity for autonomous advancement.

> How and why this cognitive schema (Developmentalism) emerges?

| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Teleological Orientation**     | Assumes a desirable end-state (modernity, industrialization, autonomy) that can be progressively reached.                     |
| **Comparative Positionality**    | Views nations in a developmental hierarchy — “underdeveloped,” “developing,” “developed” — with progress judged relationally. |
| **Agency-Capacity Assumption**   | Presumes that collective, especially state-led, action can alter developmental trajectories.                                  |
| **Historicist Temporality**      | Understands development as a temporal unfolding — history as a process of transformation, not stasis.                         |
| **Problem-Solution Framing**     | Underdevelopment is not natural but a deviation or failure — solvable through policy, reform, or institutional change.        |
| **Rational-Constructivist Bias** | Belief in the power of planning, policy, and institution-building to engineer progress.                                       |
| **National-Scale Cognition**     | The nation-state is the primary unit of analysis and transformation.                                                          |

## Ontological Signature

> You could treat developmentalism as a real system, made up of institutions, state forms, bureaucratic capabilities, ideologies, and class coalitions — i.e., a historically instantiated configuration.

> This moves beyond ideas and into what developmentalism does in the world — how it organizes production, coordinates actors, disciplines capital, structures the state, etc.

> So it's not just a lens, but a material-social arrangement or an institutional complex.

## Observer Faulty Path: Mediocre Comparison

> A nice try at rationalizing the present—without realizing that it is not a given, but a contingent outcome—instead of adopting an operational, anti-necessitarian approach that seeks to understand and actively drive transformation.

A recurring idea in certain discourses on Latin American underdevelopment goes something like this: “We are part of Latin America; therefore, we are underdeveloped.” Rather than providing an actual explanation, this kind of claim acts as a rhetorical shortcut that masks the complexity of the problem.

Comparisons between countries at similar development levels in the region are often deployed more as excuses than as analytical tools. The logic typically follows this pattern: “We belong to a group of countries with similar characteristics, and all of us perform poorly—therefore our situation is understandable.” This reasoning implicitly treats membership in a regional cluster as a justification for stagnation. It is fundamentally flawed.

First, it reduces diagnosis to a kind of collective consolation: “We’re not doing so badly because everyone else is doing just as poorly.” But this comparison explains nothing. It is circular reasoning that evades the real question: Why does this group—or many of its members—tend toward persistent mediocrity on key development indicators?

Rather than illuminating underlying causes, this framing obscures the need for deeper structural, institutional, or historical analysis. It normalizes inertia. Underperformance becomes an assumed condition of group identity rather than a challenge to be interrogated. The result is a form of intellectual and political surrender, one that fosters a race to the middle: if everyone is stuck, there is little incentive to stand out, reform, or innovate. The implicit goal becomes not falling below the average, rather than breaking from it.

**Consequences of this Thinking and Framing:**

* Normalization of Stagnation: Mediocre outcomes are perceived as natural, reducing motivation to question or disrupt the status quo.
* Erosion of Strategic Imagination: Long-term planning and transformational ambition are replaced with reactive policy and low benchmarks.
* Suppression of Accountability: Structural failures are blamed on regional identity or “shared fate” rather than on actionable domestic choices.
* Distorted Policy Benchmarking: Instead of comparing with successful transformations (e.g., South Korea, Taiwan), observers limit comparisons to similarly stagnant cases, reinforcing low expectations.
* Institutional Drift: Without external pressure or internal ambition, institutions adapt to survive within mediocrity rather than evolve to lead.
* Resignation over Reform: Reformist momentum weakens under the belief that “this is just how things are here.”

## QA

### What explains the emergence of a developmentalist (techno-productivist) cognitive schema among political and social actors in some societies, while it fails to take root in others?

> Note: When we refer to schema adoption, we are not speaking of society as a whole, but rather of a critical mass of relatively influential observers within the system.

> How can we detect if a segment of society is operating under the 'developmentalist (techno-productivist) cognitive schema'?

> Which computational or theoretical frameworks best capture the emergence of cognitive schemas like techno-productivism, and how can we validate these models using historical, experimental, or large-scale textual data? Is the target process even predictable or computable reducable?

> How can an explanatory theory be constructed to account for the emergence and diffusion of developmentalist cognitive schemas?

#### Problem Setting

**Consider a society, denoted as S1, for which we collect longitudinal data on the following dimensions:**

* The society's complex state at each time point `t` (e.g., socio-economic indicators, institutional configurations, technological capabilities),
* Internal observer perceptions (e.g., survey data, political discourse, elite narratives),
* Cross-societal observations (e.g., benchmarking against peer societies or global indices).

**The central question is:**

> *What modeling approaches can be used to predict the emergence of a developmentalist (techno-productivist) cognitive schema in society S1, and what types of empirical evidence would constitute valid confirmation of such a model?*

#### Modelling

- Hidden Markov Models
- Agent-Based Modeling
- System Dynamics Modeling
- Bayesian Network Modeling
- Causal Inference Frameworks
- Natural Language Processing & Discourse Analysis

#### Model Validation

1. Predictive Accuracy: Models should accurately predict emergence of developmentalist schemas in historical cases Out-of-sample testing on data from other societies would validate generalizability


2. Process Tracing:  Detailed case studies of societies that have undergone similar cognitive shifts
Evidence that the causal mechanisms identified by models actually operated in these cases


3. Counterfactual Validation: Testing whether models correctly predict what would have happened in the absence of certain conditions This could involve natural experiments or synthetic controls


4. Convergent Validation: Multiple modeling approaches pointing to similar predictors and mechanisms
Triangulation across different data sources and methodological approaches


5. Theoretical Coherence: Models should align with established theories from sociology, political economy, and cognitive science They should offer plausible explanations of how cognitive schemas emerge and spread


6. Longitudinal Consistency : Models should remain consistent as more longitudinal data becomes available Predictions should not be falsified by subsequent data collection

#### Empirical Confirmation

| **Policy Alignment**          | Rise in development-oriented industrial policies           | Export upgrading, value chain policies, infrastructure investment |
| **Institutional Reforms**     | Creation or empowerment of productivity-oriented agencies  | Productivity Commission, Tech Innovation Ministry                 |
| **Survey Attitudes**          | Populace increasingly supports investment in tech/industry | "We should become more like Germany/Korea" sentiments             |
| **Cross-Society Positioning** | Explicit adoption of role models in national plans         | “We aim to be the next Singapore”                                 |

#### What conditions underlie the emergence of operational-conceptual economic cognitive schemas—such as the Techno-Productivist Cognitive Schema—as opposed to surface-level reformist frameworks or other shallow **developmental cognitive framework**?

> Many societies adopt surface-level development strategies—such as tourism promotion, FDI liberalization, or basic infrastructure expansion—that improve immediate outcomes without altering the fundamental architecture of economic logic. In contrast, a smaller set of nations articulate and institutionalize deep operational-conceptual schemas—coherent systems of developmental reasoning, institutional coordination, and cultural-economic norms. One such schema is the Techno-Productivist Cognitive Schema (TPCS), characterized by long-term productive orientation, systems-level policy intelligence, and organizational architectures designed for structural transformation.


> The emergence of such schemas is basically **computationally irreducible**:  highly sensitive to historical contingencies, path-dependent dynamics, and complex interactions. Still, we can identify enabling conditions, structural pressures, cognitive thresholds, and propagation mechanisms that make the emergence of these schemas more likely.

| **Structural Preconditions** | **Statecraft Tradition**                  | Institutionalized policy apparatus capable of long-term planning and coordinated execution. | Developmental states evolved ministries for techno-industrial policy (e.g., MITI in Japan, EDB in Singapore). |
|                              | **Relative Internal Political Stability** | Sufficient regime continuity to sustain multi-decade strategies.                            | Reduces populist swings; allows strategic industrial policy to take hold (e.g., China post-1978).             |
|                              | **Bureaucratic Meritocracy**              | Technocratic staffing of key agencies based on competence rather than patronage.            | Enhances rational policy learning and schema refinement (e.g., Taiwan’s technocratic planners).               |
| **Diffusion Mechanisms**     | **Exposition & Mimicry**                  | Exposure to successful developmental trajectories triggers emulation.                       | Vietnam mimicked China and Korea’s techno-industrial approaches.                                              |
|                              | **Network Effects**                       | Regional and institutional clustering fosters schema convergence and feedback.              | Industrial ecosystems (e.g., Shenzhen, Hsinchu) produce cultural-institutional lock-in.                       |
|                              | **Historical Schemas as Precursors**      | Legacy frameworks create scaffolds for deeper schema adoption.                              | Former socialist or nationalist industrial systems ease adoption of new techno-structural logic.              |
| **Triggering Forces**        | **Competitive Pressures**                 | External geopolitical or economic threats incentivize strategic overhaul.                   | Meiji Japan modernized rapidly to avoid Western colonization.                                                 |
|                              | **Crisis-Driven Reorientation**           | Severe internal dislocations delegitimize status-quo paradigms.                             | 1997–1998 crises catalyzed reform in Indonesia and South Korea.                                               |
|                              | **Catalytic Observer-Elite**              | Key individuals or epistemic coalitions articulate and promote the schema.                  | Visionary policymakers or technocrats (e.g., Park Chung-hee, Deng Xiaoping) function as schema entrepreneurs. |
| **Reinforcement Dynamics**   | **Threshold Effects**                     | Schema becomes stable only after sufficient elite/institutional alignment.                  | Once critical mass is achieved, reform becomes irreversible (e.g., China 1980s).                              |
|                              | **Reinforcement Loops**                   | Early techno-industrial success builds legitimacy and locks in schema.                      | South Korea’s export boom sustained its developmentalist orientation.                                         |
| **Schema Path Dependency**   | **Cognitive Capital of Observers**        | Policy elites' interpretive depth shapes schema sophistication.                             | Analytical institutions (e.g., think tanks, tech universities) create fertile ground for conceptual depth.    |
|                              | **Memory of Past Frameworks**             | Nations draw upon prior development efforts and institutional logics.                       | Brazil's cyclical return to developmentalism reflects memory of mid-century industrial policy.                |
|                              | **Epistemic Rigor**                       | Preference for systemic, engineering-like approaches over ideological simplicity.           | Societies with scientific or engineering culture prefer feedback-driven planning (e.g., Germany, Taiwan).     |
|                              | **Autochthonous Schemas**                 | Indigenous conceptual traditions provide compatible scaffolding.                            | Chinese Legalism or Confucian meritocratic ethos align with state-led techno-governance.                      |

#### Case Studies

> **Note:** These case studies illustrate conditions under which developmentalist (techno-productivist) schemas emerged, stabilized, or failed to take root. “Schema” refers to the dominant operational-conceptual orientation among a critical mass of elite observers—not the entire society.

> Note: What matters here is not the specific content, but the underlying architecture of the analysis. Some entries are incomplete or inaccurate. Take the case of Tokugawa Japan: many of the conceptual innovations associated with developmentalism—such as the idea of “rich nation, strong army” (fukoku kyōhei)—were already present during that period. What changed during the Meiji era was not the invention of these ideas, but their consolidation into a dominant, state-led developmental schema. This kind of continuity should be reflected in the “conditions” and “proto-schema” fields of the case studies.

> Note: Conditions refer to the state of a society at a specific reference point in time. This includes its material structure (e.g., technological base, productive systems), institutional configurations, and the distribution of observer schemas (i.e., which cognitive frameworks are held by influential actors). Conditions are not just background variables—they define the cognitive and structural landscape in which schema shifts may or may not occur.
