> **Cursus Honorum**: Latin for ‘course of honors’, or more colloquially ‘ladder of offices’) was the sequential order of public offices held by aspiring politicians in the Roman Republic and the early Roman Empire. It was designed for men of senatorial rank. The cursus honorum comprised a mixture of military and political administration posts; the ultimate prize for winning election to each “rung” in the sequence was to become one of the two consuls in a given year. Each office had a minimum age for election; there were also minimum intervals between holding successive offices and laws forbade repeating an office.

> **Policy Design**: **Policy Design** is the strategic and deliberate process of formulating measures and frameworks to address specific societal, economic, or regulatory challenges effectively.
