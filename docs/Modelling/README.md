# ðŸ§  Modeling

> To **understand society** is not to describe its surface, but to trace the hidden structures that shape human possibility. A good social model doesnâ€™t reduce complexity â€” it reveals its structure.

## ðŸ“Œ Principles

> **Perception over Reality**: Decisions made by agents in social systems are not necessarily based on objective reality, but rather on their **perceptions and interpretations** of that reality. These subjective constructions shape behavior and systemic outcomes.

## Modelling Framework

Creating a **modelling framework for social systems** informed by **Manuel DeLanda's philosophy**â€”especially his *assemblage theory*, *realist ontology*, and use of *dynamical systems*â€”offers a powerful way to analyze complexity in social environments without reifying entities like "society" or "culture". Here's a structured framework you can build on:

---

## ðŸ§­ **Modelling Framework for Social Systems** (Assemblage-Theoretic & Systems-Theoretic)

### I. **Ontological Commitments**

1. **Assemblages** as the fundamental units:

   * No unified "society"â€”only assemblages (e.g., families, firms, networks, institutions).
2. **Realism**:

   * Social systems exist independently of observers and are causally efficacious.
3. **Non-totalization**:

   * Avoids holistic or reductionist accounts (e.g., not society as a super-organism, nor only individual actions).

---

### II. **Core Concepts**

| Concept                                       | Description                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Assemblage**                                | A composition of heterogeneous elements (human, technical, symbolic) that form a functional whole. |
| **Relations of Exteriority**                  | Components can be detached and reassembled elsewhere; identity is not essential.                   |
| **Territorialization / Deterritorialization** | Stabilizing vs. destabilizing forces acting on an assemblage.                                      |
| **Material vs. Expressive Roles**             | Distinction between physical and symbolic or regulatory components.                                |
| **Emergence**                                 | System properties not reducible to components, arising from interaction patterns.                  |
| **Intensive Variables**                       | Non-metric drivers like pressure (conflict), temperature (intensity of discourse), etc.            |
| **Phase Space & Attractors**                  | Abstract space of all possible states and typical behavioral tendencies.                           |

---

### III. **Modelling Dimensions**

| Dimension             | Operationalization                                                          |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scale**             | Micro (individual), Meso (groups/orgs), Macro (institutions, states).       |
| **Temporality**       | Short-term dynamics, long-term evolution, historical contingency.           |
| **Stability**         | Degree of territorialization (e.g., codified laws vs. informal norms).      |
| **Connectivity**      | Network structure: nodes (actors/institutions), links (flows/interactions). |
| **Power Dynamics**    | Flow of resources, control mechanisms, regime maintenance or disruption.    |
| **Information Flows** | Communication, representation, discourse (expressive roles).                |

---

### IV. **Methodological Toolkit**

| Tool                                | Purpose                                                             |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent-Based Modelling (ABM)**     | Simulate emergence from interaction of heterogeneous agents.        |
| **Dynamical Systems Models**        | Model attractors, bifurcations, and stability zones.                |
| **Network Analysis**                | Map and measure connectivity, centrality, clustering, etc.          |
| **Qualitative Assemblage Mapping**  | Identify components and their roles (material/expressive).          |
| **Comparative Historical Analysis** | Explore how different configurations led to divergent trajectories. |

---

### V. **Example Use Case: Urban System**

* **Assemblage**: A city.
* **Components**: Infrastructure (material), legal frameworks (expressive), residents, businesses.
* **Territorialization**: Zoning laws, traffic norms.
* **Deterritorialization**: Migration, informal settlements, protest movements.
* **Dynamics**: Traffic flow patterns, housing market bubbles (emergent from micro-decisions).
* **Simulatable with**: ABMs for mobility, GIS + networks for spatial-economic flows.

---

### VI. **Advantages of the Framework**

* Respects **heterogeneity** and **multiplicity**.
* Avoids essentialism and overgeneralization.
* Enables both **qualitative depth** and **quantitative formalization**.
* Aligns with **scientific realism**, especially in its treatment of causality and emergence.

ADD MORE PHILOSOICAL OR CONCEPTUAL SYSTEMS + MODELLING SYSTEMS

Here's an expanded table with more **abstract and philosophical** modeling frameworks, including those from **Hegelian**, **Marxist**, and **other critical or theoretical traditions**. These frameworks tend to offer deep, conceptual insights rather than computational methods, and they often focus on the dynamics of power, ideology, history, and culture:

### **Additional Conceptual or Philosophical Frameworks:**

1. **Nietzschean Power Dynamics**: Focus on will to power, perspectivism, and the fluidity of social hierarchies.
2. **Lacanian Psychoanalysis**: The role of the unconscious, desire, and symbolic order in shaping social relations and identity.
3. **Deleuzian Rhizomatics**: Focus on non-hierarchical, non-linear networks of relations; flows of desire, power, and information.
4. **Posthumanism**: Moving beyond human-centered models to include the agency of non-human actors (technology, animals, ecosystems) in social systems.
5. **Eco-Marxism**: Integration of environmental concerns with Marxist class analysis, highlighting ecological crisis and capitalist exploitation.
6. **Critical Realism**: Focus on underlying structures that cause social phenomena, with an emphasis on both causal mechanisms and social practices.
