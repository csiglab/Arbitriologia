# Money

> Universal Subroggate that can take the “form” of any good / service between agents in an economy, allowing a seamless flow of goods and services in an economy.

> Money is a medium of exchange that is widely accepted in transactions for goods and services, as well as for payment of debts. It is a standardized unit of value that is used to measure and compare the worth of different goods and services.

> Money can take many forms, such as coins, banknotes, electronic transfers, and digital currencies.

> **Money** is to economics (from production to distribution) what **language** is to thought and communication.

> **Thinking of money as analogous to energy** is one of the most powerful analogies. Energy is a conserved quantity in a closed system, allowing it to change forms (e.g., from kinetic to potential energy) without being lost. Similarly, money enables the transfer of value across goods, services, and assets, facilitating economic activity without losing its fundamental ability to "do work" in economic terms.

> Money is a **relational dynamic system** of tagged value units mediated by interacting agents, operating under regulatory constraints, maintained through stateful accounting, and embedded in a broader environment of norms, platforms, and institutions.

QA:

- What the relation of a currency and assets?

Functions:

- **Medium of exchange**: Money is used as a medium of exchange to facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers. It allows people to buy goods and services without having to trade one good for another, which makes trade more efficient and enables specialization in production.
- **Unit of account**: Money serves as a standard unit of measurement for the value of goods and services. This allows people to compare the value of different goods and services and make informed economic decisions.
- **Store of value**: Money is a store of value that allows people to save their wealth and use it in the future. It can be easily stored and retrieved when needed, unlike other forms of wealth, such as livestock or crops.
- **Standard of deferred payment**: Money can be used to make payments over time, such as through loans, credit, and debt. It serves as a standard of deferred payment that allows people to borrow and lend money over time.

## Ontological Signature

> Money is not just a thing but a structured relation embedded in a social and institutional system, representing transferable and trust-based claims on value.

| **Primitive**        | **Role**                                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Interaction Unit** | Agents (individuals, firms, states) capable of holding, transferring, or demanding money. Each unit has cognitive models of value, trust, and expected exchange behavior.      |
| **Interaction**      | Transactions, payments, pricing, debt issuance, barter substitution—all forms of exchange where value is expressed or transferred.                                             |
| **Regulation**       | Rules (formal and informal) governing issuance, transfer, valuation, taxation, and legality of money. These include monetary policy, laws, credit limits, or social norms.     |
| **State**            | The state stores key information: balances, credit positions, obligations, ownership claims. In ledgers, databases, or memory—this "state" enables persistence and accounting. |
| **Tagging System**   | Units of money are tagged: denominations, serial numbers, tokens, addresses (crypto), or even reputation (in credit). These allow tracking, comparability, and exchange.       |
| **Dynamics**         | Flows of money: circulation, accumulation, inflation, credit expansion/contraction, monetary policy effects. Also includes temporal aspects like savings and deferred payment. |
| **Environment**      | The broader socio-technical and institutional context in which money operates: markets, cultures, states, platforms, technologies (e.g., gold standard vs. blockchain).        |

## Characterization

| **Dimension**                  | **Description**                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Functionality**              | Medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value, standard of deferred payment.                                                               |
| **Abstractness**               | Money is an abstraction—its value is not intrinsic but derived from collective belief, institutional support, and systemic function.             |
| **Symbolic Nature**            | Represents value, debt, or claims on future goods/services. A token in a network of obligations and entitlements.                                |
| **Relationality**              | Exists in and through social relations—e.g., creditor/debtor, payer/payee. It is not just a thing but a position in a structure of expectations. |
| **Fungibility**                | Units of money are interchangeable, enabling impersonal and generalized exchange.                                                                |
| **Standardization**            | Requires uniformity and recognizability to function across actors and transactions.                                                              |
| **Authority Embedding**        | Usually backed or sanctioned by an authoritative institution (e.g., state, bank, ledger system).                                                 |
| **Recordability**              | Money implies a system of accounts—who holds what, who owes whom—whether informal (memory, tally) or formal (bank ledgers, blockchain).          |
| **Temporal Extension**         | Functions across time: current use (payment), future claims (debt), and past transactions (savings).                                             |
| **Scarcity (Controlled)**      | Value depends on controlled issuance—absolute scarcity (Bitcoin), relative scarcity (fiat), or scarcity via social constraint (credit limits).   |
| **Mobility & Transferability** | Must be transferable across agents, institutions, and spaces.                                                                                    |
| **Trust Dependence**           | Operates only when agents trust its value will be accepted by others in the future.                                                              |
