# Social Relation

> The concept of a **Social Relation** is an abstract notion that captures the structured connections and patterns of interaction between social agents. It represents how agents relate to one another, guided by shared expectations, norms, and mutual recognition.

> Social relations are not materially substantial; they exist as emergent, relational phenomena that shape behavior, social outcomes, and the organization of social systems. They can be instantiated in concrete interactions, persist over time, and depend on both the agents involved and the conventions that sustain them.

QA:

- Is this notion - fundamental in a social ontology?

## Ontology

| Aspect                        | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Substantiality (Onticity)** | Social relations are not materially substantial; they exist as patterns of interaction and recognition among agents.                                       |
| **Instantiability**           | They can be instantiated in concrete social contexts (e.g., friendship between two people, employer-employee relations) but are abstract in definition.    |
| **Temporal Persistence**      | Social relations can persist over time (long-term friendships) or be transient (one-time transactions), depending on social and contextual reinforcement.  |
| **Cognitive Accessibility**   | They are cognitively accessible through perception of behaviors, communication, and social cues, and are understood intersubjectively.                     |
| **Conventional Dependency**   | Social relations often depend on shared conventions, norms, or cultural practices to exist and be meaningful.                                              |
| **Dependence**                | They require the existence of at least two agents and the network of interactions connecting them.                                                         |
| **Causality**                 | Social relations can influence behaviors, decision-making, and social outcomes; they can also be shaped or disrupted by changes in agents or norms.        |
| **Order of Existence**        | Social relations belong to the level of relational and emergent phenomena: one abstraction above individual agents but below systemic societal structures. |

## Formulation

> How do we identity a social relation? How to formalize the recognition? Does a social relation entails expectation?

Given agents $(a, b \in A)$, we say a social relation $R(a,b)$ **exists** if all of the following hold:

$\exists, \text{interaction } I(a,b) \land \exists, \text{norms or expectations } E(a,b) \land \text{cognitive recognition by } a \text{ and } b$

* $I(a,b)$ = measurable or observable interaction
* $E(a,b)$ = shared expectations or norms
* Cognitive recognition ensures that the relation is socially meaningful, not merely coincidental co-occurrence

## Limits

> Which are the limits of the `Concept`?

> Social relations are inherently context-dependent and relational; they cannot exist in isolation without agents and shared frameworks of recognition. Their abstraction makes them difficult to measure directly and requires proxies (interactions, communication, behaviors) for empirical analysis.
