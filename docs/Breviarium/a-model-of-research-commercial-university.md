# A Model of Research & Commercial University

> In this note, we will explore ideas on transforming the traditional research university into a new teaching-research-and-industrial university.

> The new type of institution will be called `Tecnosis`.

## Goal

> What are the goals of the new institutional design?

- Scalability
- Governance & Accountability
- Financial & Legal Flexibility
- End-to-End Vision: Education, research, and impact through commercialization

## Formulation

> Organizing the university as a holding of multiple entities allows for a modular and heterogeneous structure, where each entity can specialize in research, education, or industry collaboration while maintaining coordinated governance and shared strategic goals.

## Structure

> The following propose structure:

- Council (Board) -> Rector.
- Intelligence Unit
- Audit
- Control
- Coordination Unit PMO (Project Management Office)
- Operation

## Operation

- Financial Unit
- ...

### Training Unit
