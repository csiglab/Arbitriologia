## Measurements Methods

| **GDP Measurement Method** | **Description** | **Key Components** | **Use Case** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Production (Output) Method** | Measures GDP by calculating the total value of goods and services produced within a country, minus the costs of inputs used in production. | Value added at each stage of production | Useful for assessing sector-specific contributions to GDP and understanding production efficiency. |
| **Expenditure Method** | Measures GDP by summing up all expenditures on final goods and services within an economy, including consumer spending, investment, government spending, and net exports. | Consumption + Investment + Government Spending + (Exports - Imports) | Commonly used to assess demand-side economic activity and analyze consumption and investment trends. |
| **Income Method** | Calculates GDP by summing up all incomes earned in the production of goods and services, including wages, profits, rents, and taxes minus subsidies. | Wages + Profits + Rent + Taxes (minus subsidies) | Helps in understanding the distribution of income across different factors of production. |
| **Value-Added Method** | Often used within the production method, this calculates GDP by measuring the value added at each stage of the production process, avoiding double-counting intermediate goods. | Sum of value added at each production stage | Useful for analyzing contributions by industry and ensuring accuracy by avoiding intermediate values. |
| **Gross National Product (GNP)** | Measures the value of goods and services produced by the residents of a country, including net income from abroad. | GDP + Net Income from Abroad | Useful for understanding the economic performance of a nationâ€™s citizens and firms globally. |
