# Dynamics of the Research Facet

Development StagesL:

| Development Stage | Description | Key Characteristics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Imitation** | In the initial stage, technologies and processes are copied from more advanced systems. | - Reliance on foreign technology<br>- Limited innovation<br>- Focus on learning and adopting existing technologies |
| **2. Assimilation** | Gradual adaptation and improvement of imported technologies and processes to local needs. | - Incremental improvements<br>- Localization of technologies<br>- Development of basic R&D capabilities |
| **3. Adaptation** | Significant modifications and enhancements to imported technologies led to improved versions. | - Active R&D to enhance technologies<br>- Increased local innovation<br>- Focus on tailoring technologies to local markets |
| **4. Innovation** | Developing new, original technologies and processes contributes to global knowledge and markets. | - High R&D investment<br>- Creation of novel products/processes<br>- Strong intellectual property and innovation ecosystem |
| **5. Global Leadership** | We lead global R&D with cutting-edge technologies and significant contributions to international innovation. | - Dominance in advanced technologies<br>- Continuous breakthrough innovations<br>- Leadership in international R&D collaborations |

This table outlines the progression from imitation to global leadership, highlighting the evolution of R&D capabilities and the focus at each stage.
