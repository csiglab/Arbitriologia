# Power

> Power, in its most general sense, is the capacity to influence, shape, or constrain the decision space of other agents—or even of groups of agents.

> Note: `Power` is primarily classified as a relational concept in our ontology, but it also exhibits dynamics, context-dependence, and emergent properties.

## Signature

> What is the ontological nature of the concept of power?

- Category: Relational and emergent property
- Substrate: Exists only within social contexts; does not have independent material existence but manifests through actions, structures, and norms.

## Property

- Relational: Requires at least two entities — one that exercises power, one over which power is exercised.
- Dynamic: Can increase, decrease, or shift depending on social, political, or economic conditions.
- Context-dependent: Its expression and recognition vary across cultures, historical periods, and institutional arrangements.
- Latent vs. Manifest: Power may exist in potential (structural, institutional) or in observable actions (decisions, coercion, influence).

## Mechanism(s)

> How does power operates?

- Authority: Legitimate and institutionalized power recognized by social norms.
- Influence: Power operates by shaping the beliefs, preferences, or perceptions of other agents, guiding their decisions without direct coercion.
- Control of Resources: By controlling access to critical resources (information, wealth, tools, or networks), power constrains or enables options available to others.
- Norms and Legitimacy: Power is exercised through the establishment, reinforcement, or manipulation of social norms, rules, and institutional legitimacy.
- Coercion and Enforcement: Power can manifest as the ability to impose costs or penalties, compelling compliance through threats or force.
- Structural Embedding: Power is embedded in social, organizational, or institutional structures, creating latent influence even without direct action.

## Manifestation(s)

- Influence: Ability to shape others’ behavior without coercion.
- Coercion: Capacity to compel compliance through threat or force.
- Control of Resources: Power tied to access to critical economic, informational, or technological assets.
