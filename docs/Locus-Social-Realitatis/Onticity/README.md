# Onticity

> In this section of our notes, we analyze a set of **general elements**—both **ontic** and **non-ontic**—that do not fit easily into other branches of study.
>
> **Onticity** refers to the degree to which an entity is **“real”** or **independently existing**, ranging from fully concrete and material to abstract, relational, or purely conceptual.

> What are the most crucial elements, ontic or not, necessary to parse social reality?

## Onticity Map

> Which elements—ontic or non-ontic—are the primary targets of study in the social field?

> In what ways can non-ontic elements (e.g., norms, beliefs, symbols) be meaningfully studied or measured?

> What criteria determine whether a non-ontic element is a valid and useful object of investigation?

> Do non-ontic elements exist?  Is it valid to ask about their existence? What do we mean by
“existence”?

> **Note:** In this branch, we focus on **certain elements** that are difficult to place in other branches of study. On the **Onticity ladder**, these elements typically occupy the **higher levels**, meaning they often have a **broad range of relational, symbolic, or conceptual reality**, rather than being purely material or easily measurable.

> Note: This is just an example - a detailed thesaurus will be created in [Element Map](./Map/README.md)

| **Biological**            | Body, genetics, adaptation                           | Ontic                                           | Organic substrate of human existence; measurable and embodied.                      |
| **Behavioral**            | Action, ritual performance, bodily gesture           | Dual (Ontic + Non-ontic)                        | Physically enacted but meaningful through shared symbols.                           |
| **Relational**            | Kinship tie, alliance, exchange, power relation      | Emergent / Relational                           | Exist only through interaction; not things but structured connections.              |
| **Institutional**         | Marriage, economy, law, governance                   | Semi-ontic / Reified                            | Stabilized relational patterns that acquire apparent objecthood through repetition. |
| **Symbolic**              | Symbol, myth, totem, representation                  | Non-ontic                                       | Abstract meaning systems that organize understanding and behavior.                  |
| **Linguistic**            | Language, discourse, naming, grammar                 | Dual (Ontic in medium / Non-ontic in structure) | Materialized as sound or text but essentially an abstract system.                   |
| **Cognitive**             | Category, schema, worldview, belief                  | Non-ontic                                       | Mental and conceptual structures organizing perception and reasoning.               |
| **Social-Structural**     | Roles, norms, hierarchies, status positions          | Emergent / Semi-ontic                           | Patterned expectations among agents; have durability but no independent substance.  |
| **Affective**             | Emotion, attachment, value                           | Emergent / Non-ontic                            | Phenomenological and relationally generated; felt but not object-like.              |
