## Beggar-thy-neighbor

### üß® Implicit Beggar-thy-Neighbor Effect (Even Without Tariffs or Manipulation)

Advanced economies can unintentionally **reproduce beggar-thy-neighbor outcomes** through:

- **Export of deflationary pressure** (e.g. overproduction).
- **Control of standards, IP regimes**, and global production networks.
- **Dominance in setting global value chain architecture.**


### ‚ö†Ô∏è Consequences of Beggar-thy-neighbor Mercantilism in Open Trade Between Advanced and Rising Economies
| **Mechanism** | **How It Works** | **Consequences** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Technological Asymmetry** | Advanced nations export high-tech, high-margin goods; rising economies export raw materials or low-tech goods. | Rising economies remain stuck in **low-value production** and **structural trade deficits**. |
| **Terms of Trade Deterioration** | Prices of exports from rising economies grow slowly, while import costs rise. | **Worsening balance of payments** and weak capital accumulation in developing nations. |
| **Industrial Suppression** | Open markets flooded with cheap, efficient foreign products. | **Domestic industry can't compete**, leading to deindustrialization or blocked industrial takeoff. |
| **Loss of Technological Sovereignty** | Dependence on imported machinery, inputs, and standards. | Limits development of **endogenous innovation capacity**. |
| **Brain Drain and Talent Extraction** | High-skilled labor migrates to advanced economies for better opportunities. | Weakens the rising country‚Äôs **human capital base** and innovation system. |
| **Financial Volatility** | Advanced nations attract capital; rising economies experience capital flight or boom-bust cycles. | **Macroeconomic instability**, currency crises. |
