    Key Features:

        Diverse Tax Mix: Income tax (up to 45%), VAT (19%), and trade taxes fund the worldâ€™s 4th-largest economy.

        "Black Zero" Policy: Constitutional debt brake limits deficits (except in crises like COVID-19).

        Strong SME Tax Base: Mid-sized companies ("Mittelstand") drive stable revenue.

    Why It Works:

        Low corruption and efficient tax collection.

        Debt-to-GDP has fallen since the 2010s (~65% in 2023).
