> **Clusters** can be defined as geographical concentrations of interconnected industry firms that cooperate among themselves, creating competitive advantages on doing so (Porter, 1990). The pioneer study about this matter is by Alfred Marshall (1920), which brought the concept of
industrial district, an agglomeration of small businesses in the same locality.
> 

> **Clusters are geographic** concentrations of interconnected companies, specialized suppliers, service providers, and associated institutions in a particular field. Porter argues that industries thrive when they exist nearby and share common resources, technologies, and workforce skills.
> 

> **Cluster Policy** is a strategic approach in productive policy aimed at fostering economic growth by promoting the development of geographically concentrated groups of interconnected industries, firms, and institutions to enhance innovation, competitiveness, and collaboration.
> 

> Tailored support programs, sector-specific incentives, and development roadmaps for manufacturing, agriculture, and services industries.
> 

> The policy space to develop or enhance a productive ecosystem involves creating an enabling environment through targeted regulations, incentives, and institutional frameworks.
> 

> **Supply Chain Resilience Programs:**  Policies and initiatives focused on building resilient and robust supply chains to mitigate risks and disruptions.
> 

> **Cluster policy** involves targeted initiatives by governments to promote collaboration, innovation, and competitiveness among interconnected businesses and institutions within specific geographic or industry clusters.
> 

> An **economic sector** refers to a distinct segment of the economy with similar types of economic activities, such as agriculture, manufacturing, or services.
> 

> Promote an **holistic thinking** around productive activities and structures.
> 

> Modeling the competitiveness of an industrial ecosystem in a country involves capturing and analyzing key concepts that influence the performance, growth, and sustainability of industries.

> «…los países y las regiones que logran tener altas tasas de crecimiento son aquellos que logran acumular la mayor cantidad de know-how, pero no tanto a nivel individual, sino a nivel colectivo: el todo sabe más porque cada individuo sabe distinto; es la división del know-how entre individuos lo que permite que la sociedad en su conjunto sepa más: la especialización a nivel individual lleva a la diversificación a nivel colectivo. A medida que las personas y empresas se especializan, las ciudades y las regiones se diversifican. De ahí que insista en que más que una «especialización inteligente», los territorios deben apuntarle a una «diversificación inteligente».
> 

> **Development blocks** encapsulate the concept of regional or sectoral clusters of industries, businesses, and infrastructure that interact synergistically to catalyze economic growth and innovation within a particular area or sector.

## Why do cluster policy?

- Companies did not leave in isolation - some competitive problems are at the cluster level.
- Clear Goals.
- Whatever general policy →  clusters must appear.
- Targeted policies to help cluster catch up & innovate. Because the money is limited
- …

## Cluster Synergies

> **Cluster synergies** arise from the concentration of related industries and organizations, enhancing productivity, accelerating R&D, fostering innovation, and driving regional economic growth through shared resources, expertise, and networks.
> 
- Production /  Service Enterprises
- Technology Mastery
- Innovation:  Testing Facilities, …
- I+D+I: Public, Universities, Private Centers
