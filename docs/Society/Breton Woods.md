The Bretton Woods Conference, held in 1944 in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, was a landmark gathering of representatives from 44 Allied nations towards the end of World War II. The primary objective was to design a new international monetary system to promote economic stability and facilitate post-war reconstruction. The conference resulted in the creation of two key institutions: the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.

The IMF was established to oversee the international monetary system, provide financial assistance to countries facing balance of payments problems, and promote exchange rate stability. Meanwhile, the World Bank aimed to provide financial and technical assistance for the reconstruction and development of war-torn and impoverished nations.

The Bretton Woods system pegged currencies to the US dollar, which was convertible to gold at a fixed rate. This fixed exchange rate regime aimed to promote stability and facilitate international trade and investment.

However, the Bretton Woods system eventually faced challenges, particularly due to the growing US trade deficit and the inability to maintain the gold convertibility of the dollar. This led to the breakdown of the fixed exchange rate system in the early 1970s, known as the "Nixon Shock," when President Richard Nixon suspended the dollar's convertibility to gold.

Despite its eventual demise, the Bretton Woods Conference and the institutions it created laid the foundation for international economic cooperation and played a significant role in shaping the post-war global economic order. The IMF and the World Bank continue to play vital roles in promoting economic stability, development, and poverty reduction worldwide.
