**"Subcontracting Linkages"** refer to the relationships between a primary contractor and subcontractors in a supply chain or project. These linkages involve the delegation of certain tasks or responsibilities by the primary contractor to subcontractors, often for specialized or ancillary work. Subcontracting linkages are common in various industries, including construction, manufacturing, and service provision. They enable primary contractors to focus on core competencies while leveraging the expertise and resources of subcontractors to fulfill specific aspects of a project or contract. Efficient management of subcontracting linkages is crucial for ensuring project success, cost-effectiveness, and timely delivery.
