# Economic Cycle

> The economic cycle—also known as the business cycle—refers to the recurring pattern of expansion and contraction in overall economic activity over time. It typically includes four phases: expansion, peak, contraction (or recession), and trough. These cycles are influenced by various factors such as consumer behavior, investment trends, fiscal and monetary policy, and external shocks (war, pandemies, etc).

## Keynesian

> Keynesian economic policies, which advocate for counter-cyclical government spending during periods of economic decline, aim to prevent deeper recessions by sustaining aggregate demand. While formalized in the 20th century, similar approaches have been employed in various forms throughout history.
