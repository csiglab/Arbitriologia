## Study Guide

> What should we teach first? Should we teach the correct but unfamiliar law with its strange and difficult conceptual ideas, for example the theory of relativity, four-dimensional space-time, and so on? Or should we first teach the simple “constant-mass” law, which is only approximate, but does not involve such difficult ideas? The first is more exciting, more wonderful, and more fun, but the second is easier to get at first, and is a first step to a real understanding of the first idea. This point arises again and again in teaching physics. At
different times we shall have to resolve it in different ways, but at each stage it is worth learning what is now known, how accurate it is, how it fits into everything else, and how it may be changed when we learn more.  - **Feynman.**

However, modern thermodynamics encompasses a far broader range of phenomena, including general energy transformations and the principles of entropy. A more accurate name today might be “Energetics and Entropy Theory.”

- **Max Planck (1900):**  "On the Law of Distribution of Energy in the Normal Spectrum." : Contribution: Introduced the concept of quantization of energy, proposing the idea of quantized energy levels or "quanta" to explain blackbody radiation.
- **Albert Einstein (1905):** "On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light." : Proposed the photoelectric effect, demonstrating that light can be described as discrete packets of energy (photons).
- **Louis de Broglie (1924):**  "Recherches sur la théorie des quanta" ("On the Theory of Quanta"):  Introduced the idea of wave-particle duality, suggesting that particles, such as electrons, can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior.
- **Werner Heisenberg (1925):** "Über quantentheoretische Umdeutung kinematischer und mechanischer Beziehungen" ("Quantum-Theoretical Reinterpretation of Kinematic and Mechanical Relations") -  Formulated matrix mechanics, a foundational approach to quantum mechanics focusing on matrices and observables.
- **Erwin Schrödinger (1926):**  "Quantisierung als Eigenwertproblem" ("Quantization as an Eigenvalue Problem") Contribution: Developed wave mechanics, an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics based on wave functions and partial differential equations.
- **Max Born, Werner Heisenberg, Pascual Jordan (1926):** "Zur Quantenmechanik II" ("On Quantum Mechanics II") Contribution: Introduced the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics, known as matrix mechanics.
- **Paul Dirac (1927):** "The Quantum Theory of the Emission and Absorption of Radiation." -  Developed quantum field theory, which combines quantum mechanics with special relativity, and introduced the Dirac equation describing relativistic electrons.
- **Max Born (1928):**  "On Quantum Mechanics of Collisions." - Formulated Born's rule connects the wave function to the probability of finding a particle in a particular state.
- **John von Neumann (1932):**  "Mathematische Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik" ("Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics") -  Provided a rigorous mathematical quantum mechanics formulation, incorporating matrix and wave mechanics into a unified framework.
