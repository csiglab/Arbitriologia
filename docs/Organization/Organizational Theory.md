# Organizational Theory

: 21

> **Organizational Theory** is the study of how organizations are structured, how they function, and how they interact with their environment to achieve goals and improve performance.
> 

Questions:

- Given a number of agents -> how  to detect if they form an organization?
- How to design an organization?

Organizations are social entities that:

1. are goal-directed,
2. are designed as deliberately structured and coordinated activity systems and,
3. are linked to the external environment.
