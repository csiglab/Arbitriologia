# Locus Meliorandis

> Societies — through the actors within them — recursively observe themselves, assess their conditions, and formulate diagnoses. From this process emerges a shared and distributed mental schema that guides collective action toward the transformation of social reality.

QA:

- What types of social coordination are necessary to produce specific kinds of change?
- Can some changes emerge explosively without any form of coordination?
- How can we develop a meta-theory of change within complex social realities?
- How to reason about coordination?
- How can we reason about spontaneous order?
- How can we reason about tipping points and phase transformations?
- Can complex economic ecosystems emerge spontaneously in structurally underdeveloped countries, or do they require deliberate coordination and institutional scaffolding?
- What are the fundamental constraints and scalability boundaries inherent to self-organizing systems, particularly in terms of structural complexity, coordination capacity, and emergent behavior? To what extent can self-organizing architectures scale without centralized coordination, and what structural thresholds or emergent bottlenecks constrain their performance and coherence?
- How can one simulate the dynamics of social reality, and to what extent does structure (complex interaction units) emerge as an endogenous property of social interactions?
