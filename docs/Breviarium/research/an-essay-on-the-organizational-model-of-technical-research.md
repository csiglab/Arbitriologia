| **Model**                                      | **Description**                                                       | **Governance Model**                                                                    | **Instance**                       |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Individual Investigator Model                  | Autonomous researchers pursue self-defined agendas; weak coordination | **Collegial / reputational governance**; peer recognition and informal norms dominate   | Classical university departments   |
| Chair / Laboratory Model                       | Hierarchical lab centered on a senior researcher                      | **PI-centric hierarchical governance**; authority vested in chair/lab head              | German *Lehrstuhl*; PI-led labs    |
| Institute Model                                | Semi-autonomous institutes with stable funding and long horizons      | **Director-led institutional governance** with internal academic autonomy               | Max Planck Institutes; IAS         |
| Mission-Oriented Program Model                 | Research aligned to predefined strategic objectives                   | **Programmatic command governance**; milestone and mission oversight                    | Manhattan Project; DARPA           |
| Agency-Funded Competitive Model                | Decentralized ecosystem shaped by grants                              | **Market-like allocative governance** via peer review and funding calls                 | NSF; NIH; Horizon Europe           |
| Platform / Infrastructure Model                | Shared facilities and tools for external users                        | **Stewardship governance**; technical boards and access committees                      | CERN; GenBank                      |
| Consortium / Network Model                     | Federated coordination across institutions                            | **Federated / negotiated governance**; treaties, MOUs, joint committees                 | Human Genome Project; ITER         |
| Corporate R&D Model                            | Research embedded in firm strategy                                    | **Managerial–strategic governance** aligned with corporate objectives                   | Bell Labs; IBM Research            |
| Skunkworks / Advanced Concepts Model           | Small, insulated high-risk teams                                      | **Exceptional autonomy governance**; direct executive sponsorship                       | Lockheed Skunk Works               |
| Open Science / Commons Model                   | Community-driven, open participation                                  | **Normative / community governance**; codes, maintainers, consensus                     | Open-source research ecosystems    |
| State-Strategic Research Complex               | Research integrated with national strategy                            | **State-bureaucratic governance**; planning, ministerial oversight                      | Soviet Academy; Chinese state labs |
| **Applied Technology Center (Tecnalia Model)** | Contract-driven applied research and tech transfer                    | **Tripartite governance** (state–industry–institute); portfolio and contract governance | **Tecnalia; Fraunhofer; TNO**      |
| Hybrid Portfolio Model                         | Meta-organization managing multiple regimes                           | **Meta-governance / portfolio governance**; allocative and evaluative oversight         | National research systems          |
