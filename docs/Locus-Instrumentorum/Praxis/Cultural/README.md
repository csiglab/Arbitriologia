# Culture

> Culture is a relatively **stable system of patterns of behavior**, meaning, and expectation, distributed across **actors**, environmental elements, and the **interactions between them**.

> **Note:** The concept of culture does not directly depend on a society's technical capacity. Two societies with vastly different technological capabilities can share the same cultural patterns—for example, different regions within the same country.

> Note: Culture is better understood as an analytical concept rather than a distinct facet of reality. In practice, any stable pattern of behavior can be considered cultural by definition.

## Etymology

> Note: I prefer the alternative Greek term Ecumene.

- **Origin:** The word **“culture”** comes from the Latin ***cultura***, which originally meant **“cultivation, tending, or care”**.
- **Root:** From ***colere***, meaning **“to till, cultivate, inhabit, care for, or worship”**.
- **Evolution of Meaning:**
  1. **Agricultural sense:** Initially referred to the cultivation of land (plants, crops).
  2. **Metaphorical sense (17th–18th century):** Extended to the “cultivation of the mind, faculties, or human capacities.”
  3. **Modern anthropological/sociological sense (19th century onward):** Refers to the **shared patterns of behavior, beliefs, symbols, values, and practices of a society or group**.

## Definition

List of Definitions:

- ✔️ Culture is a relatively stable system of patterns of behavior, meaning, and expectation, distributed across actors, environmental elements, and the interactions between them.

- Culture systems are self-systaining processes in 'behavior space'.

- Culture is not a system but an emergent pattern produced by interacting agents operating under structured conditions (institutions, norms, incentives, technologies). It persists through feedback loops, but is not reducible to any of its parts or stable over time. The term “cultural system” should only be used with caution—and only when these emergent patterns show self-stabilization and structural feedback.

- Culture is the set of shared schemas, practices, and artifacts that coordinate collective action and individual interpretation, allowing agents to make sense of their world and act within it.

- Culture is a distributed cognitive infrastructure: it externalizes memory, decision-rules, and evaluative standards, enabling coordination across time and space.

- Culture is the sediment of historical interaction: accumulated ways of doing, thinking, and valuing that constrain present choices while also being continuously reshaped.

- Culture is the ecological niche of meaning: the shared background against which behaviors, innovations, and deviations are interpreted as intelligible or unintelligible.

- Culture is not simply “what people do,” but the structured horizon of expectations and interpretive frames that make action possible, intelligible, and socially consequential.

## Cultural System

> A cultural system is an **effective abstraction** for describing the patterns, relationships, and dynamics of a society's shared behaviors, beliefs, and practices.

> Note: The concept of culture is highly complex. It can be understood as the operative framework through which agents act, incorporating both environmental elements (such as tools and symbols) and emergent patterns of behavior that arise from their interactions. This operating framework can itself be analyzed in terms of components such as beliefs, knowledge, expectations, and other cognitive or normative elements.

> It seems the concept of culture is too abstract. When conducting analyses or proposing changes, it is better to avoid using the term “culture” and instead refer to more specific elements or mechanisms that underlies the aggregate  and abstract concept of culture.

### Limit of Cultural System - as Effective Abstraction

- **Aggregation Problem**: Culture is often treated as a single, aggregated entity, when in reality it emerges from the behaviors, beliefs, and interactions of individual agents. Accurately modeling these underlying elements and interactions provides far more explanatory power than relying on the abstract notion of culture alone.
- **Overgeneralization (Model Actor Problem)**: Abstracting culture can obscure important variations and heterogeneity within a society.
- **Measurement challenges**: Cultural constructs are difficult to observe or quantify directly, making operationalization nontrivial.
- **Causality and complexity**: Culture interacts with social, economic, and environmental factors in nonlinear ways, complicating causal inference.
- **Intervention difficulty**: Targeting culture as a whole is rarely feasible; effective action usually requires addressing specific components or mechanisms.

### Structure

| **Component**                            | **Description**                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Actors**                               | Individuals, groups, or organizations that participate in and reproduce the culture. They are carriers, interpreters, and enforcers of cultural patterns. |
| **Practice**                             | Localized, embodied micro-behaviors performed by actors in specific contexts; the concrete enactment of norms and values.                                 |
| **Symbols & Signs**                      | Shared representations (language, images, gestures) that encode meanings. Actors use them to communicate and interpret reality.                           |
| **Norms & Rules**                        | Explicit or implicit expectations guiding behavior. Actors internalize, enforce, or modify them.                                                          |
| **Values & Beliefs**                     | Principles and assumptions about what is desirable, true, or appropriate. Actors adopt, transmit, or contest them.                                        |
| **Knowledge & Cognitive Schemas**        | Shared understanding, problem-solving frameworks, and interpretive schemas. Actors construct and apply them.                                              |
| **Institutions & Roles**                 | Organizational structures and role expectations that stabilize culture. Actors occupy and enact these roles.                                              |
| **Artifacts & Material Culture**         | Physical manifestations of cultural practices (tools, buildings, art). Actors create and use them.                                                        |
| **Communication & Interaction Patterns** | Channels and modes through which culture is transmitted and enacted. Actors engage in these interactions.                                                 |
| **Environment**                          | The total context for interaction, including physical, social, and technological settings, which shapes and constrains cultural practices.                |
| **Feedback & Adaptation Mechanisms**     | Processes allowing the system to adjust to changes. Actors innovate, learn, or resist.                                                                    |

### Cultural System as Technology

> A cultural system can be understood as a **form of social technology**—a set of mechanisms, tools, and practices that enable coordinated behavior among agents. Just like engineered technologies, cultural systems shape interactions, distribute knowledge, and create predictable patterns of behavior, while remaining adaptive and emergent.

> Viewing culture as a technology emphasizes its **functional and operative aspects**, making it easier to analyze, model, and, when necessary, intervene in specific mechanisms rather than dealing with the abstract totality of “culture.”

### Theory

> Which theoretical frameworks provide a comprehensive understanding of culture?

| **Theory**                                   | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Functionalist Theory**                     | Views culture as a system of interrelated parts that maintain social stability and cohesion. Each cultural element (norm, value, practice) serves a function for the social system. |
| **Structuralist Theory**                     | Focuses on underlying structures (binary oppositions, symbolic patterns) that organize meaning within a culture, often independent of individual consciousness.                     |
| **Interpretive (Symbolic Theory)**           | Sees culture as a system of shared symbols and meanings that actors create, interpret, and negotiate through social interaction.                                                    |
| **Conflict (Critical Theory)**               | Emphasizes power relations, inequalities, and social conflicts that shape cultural patterns. Culture is seen as both a site of domination and resistance.                           |
| **Evolutionary (Cultural Selection Theory)** | Considers culture as evolving through processes analogous to biological evolution: variation, selection, and retention of cultural traits.                                          |
| **Practice Theory**                          | Emphasizes the role of individual and collective practices (micro-behaviors) in creating, reproducing, and transforming culture.                                                    |
| **Systems Theory of Culture**                | Treats culture as a complex adaptive system, where actors, norms, values, practices, institutions, and environment interact dynamically, producing emergent patterns.               |
| **Postmodern (Constructivist Theory)**       | Views culture as fragmented, contingent, and socially constructed; rejects universal or stable structures, focusing on diversity, interpretation, and discourse.                    |

## Emergence  & Change

> How does a culture emerge? How does a culture form systems? How does a culture evolve or change over time?

> Culture emerges from the interactions, behaviors, and shared meanings of individuals within a group. It is not a pre-existing entity but a dynamic outcome of repeated social practices, communication, and interpretation.

> Cultural systems form when patterns of behavior, beliefs, norms, and values stabilize and become recognized across a group, allowing predictable social coordination. These systems are maintained through feedback loops, reinforcement of shared meanings, and adaptation to environmental and social conditions.

> Culture evolves as individuals and groups respond to new information, technologies, environmental pressures, and internal social dynamics. Change can be gradual, through incremental shifts in practices and norms, or rapid, triggered by external shocks, innovation, or deliberate interventions. Understanding cultural emergence and evolution requires analyzing both micro-level interactions and macro-level structures.

List of factors of change:

- **Technological innovation** – New tools, communication methods, or production techniques that alter how people live and interact.
- **Environmental pressures** – Changes in climate, resources, or geography that force adaptations in behavior and norms.
- **Demographic shifts** – Migration, population growth, or changes in age structure affecting social norms and practices.
- **Economic transformations** – Changes in production, trade, wealth distribution, or occupations that influence values and behaviors.
- **Political and legal developments** – New policies, laws, governance structures, or power shifts that reshape social expectations.
- **Social interactions and networks** – Spread of ideas through communities, social learning, and imitation.
- **Conflict and crises** – Wars, natural disasters, or social upheavals that disrupt existing norms and accelerate change.
- **Cultural diffusion** – Exposure to foreign practices, ideas, or beliefs through trade, media, or migration.
- **Ideologies and belief systems** – Shifts in religion, philosophy, or collective worldviews that redefine norms.
- **Education and knowledge dissemination** – Expansion of literacy, schooling, and scientific understanding altering behaviors.
- **Individual agency** – Innovators, leaders, or influential figures introducing new practices or values.
- **Feedback loops** – Reinforcement of successful practices or abandonment of ineffective ones over time.

## Evaluation

> How can cultures be evaluated and compared? or  What's is the structure of the space of cultures?

> Evaluating and comparing cultures requires identifying measurable or observable dimensions of social life rather than relying on abstract notions. Key considerations include:

- **Behavioral patterns** – Recurrent practices, rituals, and social norms.
- **Values and beliefs** – Shared moral principles, priorities, and worldviews.
- **Institutions and structures** – Formal and informal rules, governance systems, and social organizations.
- **Communication and knowledge systems** – Language, education, and information dissemination practices.
- **Adaptability and resilience** – Ability to respond effectively to internal challenges and external pressures.
- **Innovation and learning capacity** – Openness to new ideas, technological adoption, and cultural evolution.
- **Social cohesion and trust** – Strength of social networks, collaboration, and collective action.
- **Material culture and artifacts** – Tools, infrastructure, and tangible expressions of cultural practices.

### Common Pitfalls

1. Culture Is Not a Unified Object

* Culture is **heterogeneous**, encompassing symbols, norms, emotions, artifacts, and institutions.
* It is **fragmented across agents**: each individual holds a partial, subjective model.
* Treating it as a single coherent “system” risks **false simplification**.

2. Low Formal Precision

* The concept of a “cultural system” is often **loosely defined**.
* Most models lack clear **interfaces**, **state transitions**, or **input/output mappings**.
* Rarely aligns with **computational or dynamical systems theory**, limiting predictive power.

3. Non-determinism and Reflexivity

* Social systems are **reflexive**: agents reflect on and modify the system itself.
* Behavior is **context-sensitive**, not governed by fixed laws.
* Feedback loops are **semantic, emotional, or political**, not purely structural.

4. Symbolic Overreach

* “Culture” is sometimes overused as a catch-all, turning it into a **dumping ground** for unexplained complexity.
* Can result in **tautological explanations**: *“Why did they do this? Because of their culture.”*

## On Cultural Software

I’m surprised how many people don’t get that genes =/= memes. Kinda like hardware =/= software. A population can change their memes (language, religion, mythology) several times and still remain genetically the same. Like if you change OS on yr laptop, it’s still the same laptop

Also we tend to exaggerate how deeply and rapidly the memes change. For example a “change of religion” would typically be a much more superficial phenomenon than one could assume reading the narrative sources (especially written by clergy)


## QA

### What is the relation between Cultural System and Social System?

> In short, cultural systems shape **why** people act the way they do, while social systems shape **how** those actions are organized and coordinated.

A **cultural system** and a **social system** are deeply interconnected, but they are not identical:

**Cultural System**:

- Composed of shared meanings, values, norms, beliefs, and practices.
- Guides how individuals interpret their environment and interact with one another.
- Emerges from repeated social interactions and stabilizes over time.

**Social System**:

- Composed of structured relationships, institutions, roles, and networks of interaction.
- Organizes social behavior and facilitates coordination, cooperation, and governance.
- Can exist independently of specific cultural content, though culture shapes its functioning.

**Relation:**

1. **Culture as the “software” of society**: Cultural systems provide the guiding principles, shared understandings, and behavioral expectations that inform how social systems operate.
2. **Social systems as the “hardware” of culture**: Social systems give structure to cultural practices, reinforcing norms through institutions, roles, and rules.
3. **Mutual influence**: Cultural norms influence the design and operation of social systems, while social structures constrain, reinforce, or enable cultural practices.
4. **Co-evolution**: Changes in one often lead to adaptations in the other. For example, a technological innovation (cultural change) may require new organizational structures (social system adaptation), and vice versa.

### Which other concepts capture similar aspects of reality?

| **Type**              | **Basis**                          | **Example**                 | **Model as**                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Cultural System       | Shared symbols, norms, affect      | Catholic procession         | Multi-agent + symbolic computation  |
| Behavioral Convention | Self-reinforcing coordination      | Driving on the right side   | Game-theoretic equilibrium          |
| Emergent Habit        | Repeated low-friction behavior     | Jaywalking in empty streets | Stochastic or habit-based dynamics  |
| Structural Drift      | Pattern sustained by system design | Bureaucratic delays         | Systems-level inertia or affordance |

### Is all stable collective or individual behavior considered culture?

- Not all stable behaviors qualify as culture. Culture specifically involves shared meanings, norms, or patterns that are socially transmitted.
- Individual habits or rigid behaviors that lack social or symbolic significance may be stable but are not cultural.
- Similarly, collective behaviors driven purely by external constraints or coercion may not reflect culture—they only become cultural when they carry shared meaning or are voluntarily followed.

### To what extent do pre-existing cultural traits enable sustained economic growth, versus economic development fostering cultural transformation? Are there identifiable conditions under which one precedes the other, or do they co-evolve in mutually reinforcing cycles?

- No single direction universally dominates. Evidence suggests a dynamic interplay, with contextual contingencies: geography, institutions, initial cultural capital, and external shocks.
- A practical heuristic: culture sets the initial conditions, economic development provides feedback loops, and over decades or centuries, they co-evolve in mutually reinforcing cycles.
