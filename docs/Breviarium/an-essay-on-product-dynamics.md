# An Essay on National Product Dynamics

> Aka. Industry Dynamics.

Guiding Questions (Factors, Firm, Environemnt):

- What technical, scientific, or economic conditions made the product/industry possible at all?
- Which prior capabilities, adjacent products, or technological lineages did it emerge from?
- Who were the founding actors (entrepreneurs, labs, states, firms), and what incentives or constraints shaped the initial design space?
- How does the product  evolve over time?
- How the market size affects the product evolution?
- How does the competitive structure of firms—size, concentration, entry/exit dynamics—shape product evolution?
- How does the patent system influence product dynamics (innovation incentives, technological diffusion, capability accumulation)?
- What mechanisms drive performance improvement (learning curves, economies of scale, platform effects, R&D intensity, standardization)?
- How do the flows of knowledge and technical capabilities shape the strengthening and evolution of a national product?

Case Study:

- Deep Seek and China Models Production.
- USA vs China Robotics Ecosystems.
