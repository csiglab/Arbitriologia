# Supply/Demand Model

Tags: Economics

> **The Supply/Demand toy model** a theory of **economic exchange;** production and consumption.
> 

> This toy models is only an **effective model** it’s does not go into the details of production;  for example technological change; giving this model only usfeullness given a static technological setting.
> 

> Demand elasticity is a concept in economics that refers to how sensitive the quantity demanded of a good or service is to changes in other economic factors, such as price, income, or the price of related goods.
> 

> Supply creates it’s on demand - Say Law (It’s not a lot but is something that happens in many cases; when we need to find better ways to produce; make the supply happens; meaning this is new demand  to be used in the supply process).

Here are the critical aspects of demand elasticity:

1. **Price Elasticity of Demand** measures how much the quantity demanded of a product changes in response to a change in its price. If the quantity demanded changes significantly with a slight price change, the demand is considered "elastic." If the quantity demanded changes little despite price changes, it is considered "inelastic."
2. **Income Elasticity of Demand**: This describes how the quantity demanded of a good changes as consumer income changes. Goods for which demand increases more proportionately as income increases are called "normal goods," and have a positive income elasticity. Those for which demand decreases as income increases are termed "inferior goods," and have a negative income elasticity.
3. **Cross Elasticity of Demand**: This measures how the quantity demanded of one good changes in response to a change in the price of another good. It helps identify the relationships between products, distinguishing between substitutes and complements. For substitutes, the cross elasticity is positive (as the price of one increases, the demand for the other also increases). For complements, it is negative (as the price of one increases, the demand for the other decreases).

## Demand

Several consumer demand models are used in economics and marketing to analyze and understand consumer behavior. Here are a few examples:

- **The Law of Demand**: The Law of Demand states that as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa. This inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded is a fundamental principle in economics.
- **The Engel Curve**: The Engel Curve shows the relationship between consumer income and the quantity demanded of a good or service. As income increases, consumers buy more specific goods and services, such as luxury items or travel.
- **The Utility Function**: The Utility Function is a mathematical model that explains how consumers allocate their resources (i.e., money and time) to maximize their overall satisfaction or utility. It assumes that consumers choose based on their preferences and the available options and seek to maximize their utility subject to budget constraints.
- **The Theory of Planned Behavior**: The Theory of Planned Behavior is a model that explains how attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control influence consumer behavior. It posits that consumers are rational decision-makers considering various factors (such as social norms, beliefs, and attitudes) when purchasing.
- **The Diffusion of Innovation Model**: The Diffusion of Innovation Model explains how new products and ideas spread through a population over time. It identifies various types of consumers (such as innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards) and explains how different groups adopt new products or ideas at different rates.

## History

> If people do not consume a product or service, then there will not be anybody to supply that product or service for the sake of price - [Tirukkural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirukkural)
> 

> If desire for goods increases while its availability decreases, its price rises. On the other hand, if availability of the good increases and the desire for it decreases, the price comes down. - [Ibn Taymiyyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Taymiyyah).
> 

> It was not until 1767 that the phrase "supply and demand" was first used by Scottish writer James Denham-Steuart in his Inquiry into the Principles of Political Economy.  Previous ideas by Jhon Locke and Francis Hutcheson.

## Limitations

- Strengths: The model is effective for understanding foundational economic concepts like price equilibrium and the market mechanism in a static world.
- Limitations: It is static, ignores technological progress, and over-simplifies real-world complexities such as market power, information asymmetry, and externalities.
- Works only for commodity competitive markets.
- Assumes a static technological setting.
