# Facet of Social Reality

> Note: The term facet is a technical concept that denotes a distinct dimension or space of social interaction, emphasizing a particular aspect of social life. Each facet represents a coherent set of patterns, processes, or mechanisms that can be analyzed independently while remaining interdependent with other facets.

> The traditional **notion** of a system—defined as a cohesive whole with fixed boundaries—is arguably invalid as an organizing concept for representing social reality. More specialized concepts, such as **social fields**, **ecosystems**, or other **relational frameworks**, are better suited. These alternatives effectively capture the multiplicity of interacting structures, emergent dynamics, fluid and porous boundaries, and complex interdependencies that characterize the social sphere.

## Facet

> Note: These facets are intended as a lightweight way to organize our representation of the sphere of social reality. They are analytical tools, not reified entities. The usefulness of any given facet for analysis will depend on the specific purpose, context, and level of granularity of your inquiry, as well as the interactions and overlaps between facets.
