# Problematization

> This note proposes an exploration of the fundamental human process of Problematization, through which we consciously attend to the given conditions of Reality, apprehend them through Cognition, and identify alternatives—using imagination and other faculties—to recognize the gap between what is and what ought to be, thereby formulating a ‘Problem.’ We then engage the transformative power of Agency and the evaluative process of Reflection to act upon and assess these conditions.

## Terminology

## Formulation

> Problematization is the cognitive and evaluative process through which an agent actively identifies, formulates, and structures a Problem by apprehending the given conditions of Reality, discerning gaps or tensions relative to desired or normative states, and delineating the space of possible transformation through Agency. Ontologically, it is an abstract, processual entity that presupposes both the existence of conditions external to cognition and the capacity for reflective interpretation, yet its existence as a coherent process depends on conscious engagement. Problematization encompasses the systematic interrogation of assumptions, the deployment of conceptual tools to frame alternative possibilities, and the evaluative assessment that situates the emerging Problem within broader goals, constraints, or values. As such, it functions as the foundational mechanism by which Reality is rendered actionable, guiding the identification of interventions, the generation of hypotheses, and the orientation of Agency, and thereby establishing the interface through which abstract gaps are transformed into structured and tractable inquiries within cognitive, social, and systemic domains.

> A Problem is an abstract, intentional, and relational entity that emerges at the intersection of Reality, Cognition, and Agency, characterized by the apprehension of a normative gap between the current state of affairs and a desired or expected state. Ontologically, it is non-physical and dependent on a cognizing agent to identify and formulate it, yet it refers to conditions that exist independently of cognition. Its identity is constituted by (i) the given conditions or constraints that define the problem space, (ii) the cognitive interpretation that discerns insufficiency or tension, (iii) the implicit or explicit potential for transformative action to alter these conditions, and (iv) the evaluative dimension that situates the problem relative to broader goals or values. As such, a Problem is not merely a statement or question but a structured conceptual interface that mediates between what is and what ought to be, serving as the prerequisite and orienting framework for deliberation, decision-making, and intervention within complex cognitive and social systems.

## Identification

> How to search for good  `Problems`? What make a problem `Great`?

> A good problem is one that aligns with the tools, knowledge, or methods at your disposal, allowing you to effectively address the gap between the current state and the desired state.

## Evaluation

> How to evaluate the quality of the **Problem**?
> 

| **Criterion** | **Guiding Question** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Clarity** | Is the problem clearly stated, with well-defined boundaries and terms? | Prevents confusion and ensures shared understanding. |
| **Relevance** | Does the problem address a meaningful or consequential aspect of reality? | Ensures significance and alignment with real conditions or goals. |
| **Depth** | Does it penetrate to underlying causes or structures, rather than superficial symptoms? | Measures explanatory richness and diagnostic accuracy. |
| **Tractability** | Is the problem formulated in a way that allows for inquiry, modeling, or intervention? | Ensures it can be meaningfully engaged with through cognition and agency. |
| **Generativity** | Does the problem open pathways to new insights, hypotheses, or transformations? | Evaluates its creative and developmental potential. |
| **Contextual Fit** | Is the problem coherent within its situational, historical, or systemic context? | Guards against abstraction detached from lived or structural conditions. |
| **Reflectivity** | Does the problem formulation recognize its own assumptions, scope, and limitations? | Promotes epistemic awareness and prevents bias or reification. |
| **Transformative Potential** | If solved or addressed, would it meaningfully alter the conditions from which it emerged? | Assesses the practical and existential impact of engagement. |
| **Impacteness** | To what extent does the problem’s formulation or resolution generate tangible, measurable, or perceptible change across systems or agents? | Evaluates the *scope and intensity* of real-world or systemic influence—the degree to which the problem’s engagement produces enduring or cascading effects. |

## Pitfalls

> Which are the most common pitfalls in the process of **Problematization**?
> 

| **Pitfall** | **Description** | **Consequence** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Vagueness** | Formulating the problem in imprecise or overly broad terms, without clear boundaries or definitions. | Leads to confusion, circular discussion, and lack of direction. |
| **Superficiality** | Treating symptoms rather than underlying structures or causal mechanisms. | Produces shallow analysis and ineffective solutions. |
| **Premature Closure** | Settling on the first plausible formulation or answer without sufficient exploration. | Blocks creativity and prevents deeper understanding. |
| **Over-Abstraction** | Detaching the problem from concrete conditions or lived realities. | Makes it inapplicable or irrelevant to real contexts. |
| **Over-Complexification** | Introducing unnecessary variables or theoretical layers. | Creates paralysis by analysis and dilutes focus. |
| **Assumption Blindness** | Failing to recognize implicit frameworks, biases, or presuppositions shaping the problem. | Reinforces hidden errors and limits critical insight. |
| **Goal Confusion** | Mixing the act of understanding the problem with the desire to solve it prematurely. | Undermines diagnostic clarity and leads to reactive solutions. |
| **Fragmentation** | Isolating the problem from its systemic or relational environment. | Prevents comprehension of interdependencies and unintended effects. |
| **Lack of Reflection** | Neglecting to revisit and evaluate the adequacy of the problem formulation itself. | Causes stagnation and unexamined repetition of flawed premises. |
| Solutionism | The tendency to focus on producing solutions—often technical or procedural—without fully understanding or problematizing the underlying conditions. Popularized by Evgeny Morozov in critique of techno-optimism. |  |

## Relation

> Which are the related notions?
> 

| **Notion** | **Description** | **Relation to Problematization** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Inquiry** | The systematic pursuit of understanding through questioning and investigation. | Problematization precedes inquiry — it defines *what* is to be investigated. |
| **Sensemaking** | The process by which individuals or groups interpret and give meaning to complex situations. | Problematization activates sensemaking by highlighting ambiguity and prompting interpretation. |
| **Reflection** | The act of evaluating one’s own cognition, action, or assumptions. | Problematization triggers reflection; reflection, in turn, refines the problem. |
| **Agency** | The capacity to act intentionally and transform conditions. | Problematization gives direction to agency by identifying what requires transformation. |
| **Cognition** | The process of perceiving, representing, and reasoning about the world. | Problematization reorganizes cognition around gaps or tensions in understanding. |
| **Creativity** | The generation of novel and valuable ideas or perspectives. | Problematization provides the *stimulus* for creativity by revealing inadequacies in existing frames. |
| **Critical Thinking** | The disciplined evaluation of information and reasoning. | Problematization is its starting point — the moment of recognizing that something requires critical examination. |
| **Learning** | The process of acquiring and restructuring knowledge through experience. | Every act of learning begins with a problem: a gap between what is known and what must be known. |
| **Design** | The intentional structuring of systems, objects, or experiences toward desired outcomes. | Design reframes problems into solvable structures — it operationalizes problematization. |
| **Philosophy** | The pursuit of wisdom through conceptual clarification and critique. | Problematization is philosophy’s core operation: to question the given and rethink the necessary. |
| **Solutionism** | The tendency to focus on producing solutions—often technical or procedural—without fully understanding or problematizing the underlying conditions. Popularized by Evgeny Morozov in critique of techno-optimism. | **Contrast:** Where *Problematization* begins with questioning and deepening understanding, *Solutionism* rushes toward resolution. It treats the existence of a problem as self-evident and prioritizes efficiency over reflection, thereby suppressing genuine inquiry. |
