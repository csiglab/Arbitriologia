# An Essay on Local Action and Global Outcome

> The Problem of Composition: How Local Instruments Impact or Not Global Outcomes.

QA:

- What is required to solve a problem—that is, to deliberately produce a specified change at the system level?
- Which properties must a set of instruments possess in order to generate coherent and stable global outcomes?
- What is the underlying nature of complex social problematizations, and how does this nature constrain intervention and control?

## Problematization

A recurrent failure mode in complex social, economic, and institutional systems arises when a multiplicity of instruments and actions—each locally rational and technically sound—fails to aggregate into coherent global outcomes. By construction, most policy tools, organizational decisions, and interventions operate at a local scale: they are sector-specific, institution-bound, temporally constrained, or geographically delimited. Yet the success criteria against which they are ultimately judged—development, productivity growth, structural transformation, or social welfare—are irreducibly global.

The central problem, therefore, is not the absence of instruments or actions. On the contrary, the system often appears richly equipped: policies exist, agencies are active, budgets are allocated, and initiatives proliferate. The failure occurs at the level of integration. Local actions do not compose; their effects do not reinforce one another; feedback mechanisms are weak or misaligned. As a result, the expected global gains fail to materialize, and the final outcome—evaluated at the system level—can be catastrophic relative to the resources and effort expended.

This disconnect exposes a fundamental coordination problem: the presence of ingredients is mistaken for the presence of a recipe. Without an overarching structure that aligns local incentives, synchronizes temporal horizons, and stabilizes causal pathways, the system remains fragmented. What emerges is not cumulative progress, but dispersion, redundancy, and, in some cases, mutual interference among well-intentioned actions.

### Characterization

Across these cases, a shared pattern emerges:

- High density of instruments
- Local rationality of interventions
- Weak inter-instrument coordination
- Absence of recursive feedback and learning
- Failure of cumulative causation
