# Institutional Economics

> Institutional economics focuses on the role of institutions‚Äîrules, norms, and legal systems‚Äîin shaping economic behavior and outcomes. It contrasts with traditional economics, which often assumes perfectly competitive markets with fully informed agents.

## Domain

- **Institutions as Rules and Norms****: Formal laws, regulations, and informal social norms that govern economic interactions.

- **Transaction Costs**: Costs of exchanging goods or services beyond price, including bargaining, enforcement, and information costs.

- **Property Rights**: Definition, enforcement, and transferability of ownership rights influencing resource allocation.

- **Contracts and Contract Enforcement**: The role of legal and social mechanisms in supporting credible agreements between parties.

- **Organizational Structures**: How firms, markets, and governments organize and coordinate economic activity.

- **Path Dependence and Historical Context**: How past institutional choices shape current economic outcomes and constrain future options.

- **Collective Action and Governance**: Mechanisms for group decision-making and managing common resources.

- **Institutional Change and Evolution**: Processes through which institutions develop, adapt, or degrade over time.

## Frameworks

| **Framework/Model** | **Description** | **Key Predictions** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Transaction Cost Economics (TCE)** | Developed by **Oliver Williamson**, focuses on the costs associated with economic exchanges, especially when transaction partners have incomplete information. | - Organizations are formed to minimize transaction costs. <br> - Firms and markets are alternatives depending on efficiency in reducing transaction costs. |
| **New Institutional Economics (NIE)** | Focuses on the role of institutions in shaping economic behavior, incorporating transaction costs, property rights, and governance structures. | - Institutions (formal and informal) determine economic performance. <br> - Economic growth depends on the development of efficient institutions. |
| **Property Rights Theory** | Explores how the allocation and enforcement of property rights affect economic behavior and resource allocation. | - Clear and secure property rights lead to efficient resource allocation. <br> - Ambiguity in property rights can result in market failure or inefficient outcomes. |
| **Agency Theory** | Examines relationships where one party (the principal) delegates decision-making authority to another party (the agent), and how to align their interests. | - Incentive structures (e.g., contracts) can reduce agency problems. <br> - Information asymmetry leads to moral hazard and adverse selection. |
| **Douglass North's Theory of Institutional Change** | Focuses on how institutions evolve over time and their role in economic development, emphasizing path dependence. | - Institutional change is incremental and constrained by historical and cultural factors. <br> - Economic development is dependent on institutional stability and adaptation. |
| **The Institutional Matrix (Williamson)** | A framework analyzing the interactions between formal and informal institutions, and their effects on economic outcomes. | - The institutional matrix shapes the behavior of firms, markets, and governments. <br> - Changes in institutional rules impact transaction costs and incentives. |
| **Social Norms and Preferences (Bardhan)** | Examines how social norms and informal institutions influence economic decisions and the allocation of resources. | - Social norms can constrain or enhance economic behavior. <br> - Economic outcomes are often shaped by non-market institutions like norms, customs, and trust. |
| **Commons' Theory of Institutional Economics** | Focuses on how common-pool resources are managed and the role of collective action in preventing resource depletion. | - Collective action and governance mechanisms are essential for managing common-pool resources. <br> - Well-defined property rights and rules can prevent "tragedy of the commons." |
| **Law and Economics** | Analyzes how legal systems, rules, and contracts influence economic behavior, especially in areas like property rights, contracts, and dispute resolution. | - Efficient legal systems minimize transaction costs and promote economic activity. <br> - Property rights and contract enforcement are crucial for market efficiency. |
