Here are some notable agent models in economic theory and some of their key papers:

- **Rational Choice Theory** - This model assumes that individuals make decisions based on their self-interest and available information. The critical paper for this model is “An Axiomatic Characterization of the Quadratic Scoring Rule” by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman (1981).
- **Game Theory** - Game theory studies decision-making involving two or more individuals in strategic situations. The critical paper for this model is “Theory of Games and Economic Behavior” by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern (1944).
- **Behavioral Economics** - This model assumes that individuals are not always rational and can be influenced by psychological factors. The critical paper for this model is “Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk” by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (1979).
- **Agent-Based Modeling** - This model focuses on the behavior of individual agents and how they interact with one another. The critical paper for this model is “Garden of Forking Paths: Why multiple comparisons can be a problem, even when there is no ‘fishing expedition’ or ‘p-hacking,’ and the research hypothesis was posited ahead of time” by Andrew Gelman and Eric Loken (2013).
- **New Classical Economics** - This model assumes individuals have rational expectations and make decisions based on available information. The critical paper for this model is “Rational Expectations and the Theory of Economic Policy” by Robert Lucas Jr. (1976).
