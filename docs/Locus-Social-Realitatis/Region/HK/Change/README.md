## QA

### What Fundamentally Explains Hong Kong’s Structural Transformation to the Degree Observed?

> A satisfactory explanation must account for why the transformation occurred after 1945 rather than earlier, given that institutional quality before and after 1945 was largely unchanged.

> This raises a core analytical question: can a complex productive ecosystem emerge without a major agentic intervention or some form of ecosystem transplantation?

> Note: The transplantation was able to scale due to a competent but minimal government framework. However, this framework does not fundamentally explain the transformation itself, nor does it constitute the most important—or most difficult—component to create.

| Explanation                                                                   | Evaluation                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pre-1945 colonial institutions (rule of law, free port, contract enforcement) | Necessary background conditions, but invariant across the pre- and post-1945 periods; cannot explain timing or magnitude of transformation.                                                                 |
| Laissez-faire governance / non-intervention                                   | Permissive rather than generative; explains lack of obstruction, not the emergence of a complex productive structure.                                                                                       |
| Geographic position as China–world interface                                  | Long-standing and constant; enables trade but does not generate industrial coordination or explain post-1945 structural break.                                                                              |
| Global postwar demand for light manufactures                                  | Contributory demand-side factor; insufficient to explain ecosystem formation without coordinated supply-side capabilities.                                                                                  |
| Endogenous entrepreneurial emergence                                          | Empirically implausible at the ecosystem level without coordination; cannot account for rapid, dense SME clustering.                                                                                        |
| **Transplanted industrial ecosystem via refugee inflows**                     | **Foundational causal factor**; introduced pre-coordinated production networks, tacit knowledge, and supplier relations, explaining both the timing (post-1945) and the scale of structural transformation. |
