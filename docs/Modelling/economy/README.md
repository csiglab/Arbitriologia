# Economic Modelling

## Modelling Pitfalls

1. **Snapshot Fallacy**  Treating the present configuration of institutions, technology, and power as a timeless, exogenous frame.

2. **Universalization of Contingency**  Elevating a historically specific pattern (e.g., price-responsiveness) to a context-free “law”.

3. **Structure-Naturalization** Reifying emergent outcomes (wages, interest rates, “efficiency”) as natural or inevitable rather than produced.

4. **Exogenous-Variable Smuggling**  Hiding key drivers (state capacity, class relations, colonial history) outside the model boundary.

5. **Equilibrium Fixation**  Assuming a static attractor instead of modelling ongoing, path-dependent process.

6. **Feedback Neglect** Omitting positive/negative feedback, threshold effects, and phase transitions.

7. **Logical-Time Fallacy** Running the model in logical or comparative-static time while ignoring historical, irreversible time.

8. **Agent-Structure Dualism** Treating agents’ preferences and beliefs as exogenous rather than institutionally formed and mutable.

9. **Power & Coercion Invisibility** Leaving out the power asymmetries that the frozen configuration encodes and reproduces.

10. **Ontological Reification**  Confusing an observed empirical regularity (a system state) with a deep causal mechanism (a system rule).

11. **Policy-Local Optimization Trap**  Prescribing short-term, local optima without asking how the underlying structure may shift or collapse.

12. **End-State Teleology**  Implicitly assuming the current order is the only feasible or desirable end-state.**
