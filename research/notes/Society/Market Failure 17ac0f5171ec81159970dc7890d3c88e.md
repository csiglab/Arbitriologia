# Market Failure

: 14

> **Market failure** refers to a situation in which the allocation of goods and services by a free market is not efficient. In other words, the market fails to efficiently allocate resources to maximize social welfare.

This can occur due to various reasons, such as:

1. Externalities are when the actions of individuals or firms impose costs or benefits on others who are not involved in the transaction. For example, pollution is a negative externality because environmental damage imposes costs on society.
2. Imperfect competition occurs when markets are dominated by a small number of firms or when firms have significant market power, leading to prices that do not reflect true costs and benefits.
3. Public goods: Goods that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning that individuals cannot be excluded from using them, and one person's use does not diminish the availability to others. This leads to the under-provision of public goods by the market because individuals have no incentive to pay for them.
4. Information asymmetry occurs when one party in a transaction has more or better information than the other party, leading to inefficient outcomes. This can result in adverse selection or moral hazard problems.
