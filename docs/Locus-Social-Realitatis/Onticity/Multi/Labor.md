# Labor

> In this note we will explore the concept of labor.

Guiding Questions:

- What is the ontic nature of **Labor**?
- Is labor an intrinsic human property or a socially mediated economic relation?
- How does labor differ ontologically from other production factors (capital, land, technology)?
- Which properties or attributes define labor (e.g., productivity, intensity, skill composition, temporality)?
- How does labor interact with other ontic elements, such as capital, natural resources, and technology?
- Which processes is labor intrinsically involved in (e.g., production, exchange, training, coordination, accumulation)?
- What are the phenomena that labor underlies or manifests (e.g., value creation, social reproduction, technological innovation)?
- In which legal, institutional, and normative regimes does labor operate, and how do these structures shape its expression and recognition?
- Representation & Measurement
  - How is labor operationalized in economic models?
  - What abstractions are introduced when labor is represented as a homogeneous input?
  - What is the relationship between labor input and value creation at different levels of aggregation (task, firm, sector, economy)?
- Automation
  - What are the long-term effects of automation on the labor market?
- Wages and Real Wages
  - What is the relation between labor and wage?
  - How should real wages be interpreted ontologically?
  - What distortions arise when nominal wages are rigid but prices are flexible (or vice versa)?

## Formulation

> **Labor** is cumulative: labor embodied (reified) in a product can later function as a cooperative and facilitating input for new labor directed toward new ends. (Labor Aggregation). In Order to Do Somethign we must used something that was done before.

### What is the ontic nature of **Labor**?

> Note: Relational here means that the term is not intelligible in isolation; it only has meaning in relation to, in interaction with, and as connected to a determinate set of other elements.

Notes:

- Labor is an intentional, energy-directed activity performed by an agent under constraints, aimed at transforming states of the world. (Relational, Intentional, Process Based, Dispositional - Capacity Based, Latent Transformation Waiting to Being Enacted).
- Labor is a temporally extended, norm-governed, agent-dependent process that actualizes capacities to effect transformations in a material or symbolic domain under systemic constraints.
- Labor is a relation between agent–means–ends within a system.
- Labor is not a (Commodity, Resource, Input, Price, Time).

### How does labor differ ontologically from other production factors (capital, land, technology)?

## Wage

> A ****wage**** is a fixed regular payment, typically paid on a daily or weekly basis, made by an employer to an employee, especially for manual or unskilled work.

> ****Real wages**** refer to the purchasing power of income, adjusted for inflation, indicating the actual quantity of goods and services that can be bought with the wages earned.

## Representation > (Epistemic)

- How is labor operationalized in economic models?
- What abstractions are introduced when labor is represented as a homogeneous input?
- What is the relationship between labor input and value creation at different levels of aggregation (task, firm, sector, economy)?

## QA

### What does a theory of labor mean?

> A theory of labor is a systematic account that specifies what labor is, how it is constituted, and how it operates as a real process within social, technical, and economic systems.

> A theory of labor specifies the ontological status, constitutive conditions, and systemic roles of labor as a structured, norm-governed activity embedded in social and technical systems.

### How to Evaluate Labor? How to Reason About Its Value?

> The goal of labor is to transform reality in order to fulfill a desire or satisfy a necessity. Its value, therefore, consists in the **extent to which it contributes to achieving these ends—that is**, how **effectively** labor changes the world to meet human needs and purposes.

> The measurement of **effectiveness** can be formulated in different ways, but the most practical approach combines **quality, cost structure, and time required for production**.
