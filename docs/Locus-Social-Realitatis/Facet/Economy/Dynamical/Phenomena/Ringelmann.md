# Ringelmann Effect

The **Ringelmann Effect** describes the phenomenon where individual members of a group become less productive as the group size increases. First identified by French agricultural engineer **Max Ringelmann** in the early 20th century, the effect highlights a common challenge in teamwork and collective labor: **coordination losses and social loafing** lead to a decrease in per-person output despite the larger group size.

**Key points:**

* Originated from experiments measuring the force exerted by people pulling on a rope individually and in groups.
* Shows that total group productivity increases with size but not proportionally; per-person effort declines.
* Important in organizational psychology, management, and economics for understanding group dynamics and designing efficient teams.
