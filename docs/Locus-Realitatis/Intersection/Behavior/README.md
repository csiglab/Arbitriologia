# Behavior

> **Behavior** is typically the pattern or expression of actions by Interaction Units in response to interactions, regulations, environment, or internal state.

> Behavior is, by nature, a series of events and transformations—actions, reactions, decisions—that evolve over time.

> Is behavior regulated? Yes.

## Ontological Decomposition

| Primitive                 | Description                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Actor (Agent)**         | The entity (Interaction Unit) performing the behavior (individual, group, system component) |
| **Action**                | A basic unit of behavior, a discrete deed or activity performed by an Actor                 |
| **Event**                 | An occurrence or happening that marks a change or initiation of action                      |
| **Interaction**           | Relational process or event between two or more Actors involved in behavior                 |
| **State Change**          | Transition or transformation in the system’s state resulting from behavior                  |
| **Trigger**               | Condition or stimulus (internal or external) that initiates or influences an action         |
| **Protocol / Rule**       | Prescribed or shared behavioral norms, regulations, or constraints guiding actions          |
| **Temporal Sequence**     | Ordering and timing relations of actions and events (e.g., before, after, concurrent)       |
| **Goal / Intention**      | The purpose or motivation driving the behavior (may be explicit or implicit)                |
| **Feedback**              | Information or signals resulting from behavior that influence future actions                |
| **Environment Influence** | External conditions or context that affect the execution or form of behavior                |
| **Representation**        | Internal or external encoding of behavior, including symbolic, semantic, or tagging aspects |
