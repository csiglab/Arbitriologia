> The Washington Consensus refers to a set of ten economic policy prescriptions that were considered standard reform policies for crisis-wracked developing countries in the 1980s and 1990s. These policies were promoted by Washington, D.C.-based institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the U.S. Treasury Department. Here are the main points of the Washington Consensus:
> 

| **No.** | **Policy Prescription** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Fiscal Discipline | They are ensuring that budget deficits are small enough to be financed without creating high inflation. |
| 2 | Reordering Public Expenditure Priorities | We are redirecting public spending from subsidies and non-essential administration to areas like education, health, and infrastructure. |
| 3 | Tax Reform | Broadening the tax base and adopting moderate marginal tax rates. |
| 4 | Liberalizing Interest Rates | Allowing market forces to determine interest rates, avoiding preferential lending rates. |
| 5 | Competitive Exchange Rate | We are adopting a unified and competitive exchange rate to foster export-led growth. |
| 6 | Trade Liberalization | Reducing tariffs and other trade barriers to promote free trade. |
| 7 | Liberalization of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) | Removing barriers to foreign direct investment to attract international capital. |
| 8 | Privatization | Selling state-owned enterprises to the private sector to improve efficiency and resource allocation. |
| 9 | Deregulation | It is eliminating regulations that impede market entry and restrict competition, except for those needed for safety, environmental, and prudential reasons. |
| 10 | Property Rights | We are securing property rights to provide incentives for investment and economic activity. |

These points were intended to create a framework for economic stability, growth, and development by promoting market-oriented reforms. However, the effectiveness and impact of these policies have been widely debated and criticized, particularly concerning their social and economic consequences in various countries.
