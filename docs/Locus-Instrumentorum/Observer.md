# Observer

> The internal process within that unit that enables it to perceive, interpret, decide, remember, and learn.

> Cognition is the subsystem that gives the unit its ability to act meaningfully within interactions.

> Distributed cognition: Extends cognition beyond individual minds to include artifacts and environments.

> Groupthink: A dysfunctional form of collective cognition.

> Sensemaking: A process often carried out collectively in organizations or teams.

> Note: The 'observer' aka 'Interaction Unit' / Cognitive Function is so important that it will be trealy separtly frmo the idea of 'Interaction Unit'.

> An Observer is any entity or process that perceives, records, or interprets the behavior or structure of a system. In social theory and systems thinking, observers are not neutral‚Äîthey are embedded within the system and their observations shape, constrain, or constitute the system.

## Internal Observer

> Note: When we refer to an observer in a social system; is basicaly a critical mass of infucluencial acotrs in the system.

> An Internal Observer is an observer that is part of the system it observes. It has limited perspective and interacts with the system‚Äôs dynamics.

- In cybernetics (esp. second-order), the internal observer is reflexive.
- Cannot access a total view of the system.
- Is shaped by the system‚Äôs feedback loops and regulatory structures.
- Observations are perspectival, partial, and performative.

## üîÑ Recursive Observation

> Observers can observe other observers, or even themselves ‚Äî a principle in second-order cybernetics.

> This leads to meta-level reasoning, institutional reflexivity, and recursive design.

## Case Studies

- International organizations assessing national development.
- Researchers modeling a society without lived immersion.

## QA

> What underlies the changes inthe cognitive schema of some observer in social systems realited to country position with respect to other socieites?


## Definition

| **Aspect**              | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Process**             |  It is **a process** by which a group forms, maintains, and updates shared knowledge, beliefs, interpretations, or goals through interaction.                         |
| **Phenomenon**          |  It is also **a phenomenon**, an emergent property observable in coordinated group behavior, decision-making, and knowledge creation.                                 |
| **Mechanism**           |  It may refer to **mechanisms** (e.g., feedback loops, communication channels, distributed memory) enabling distributed reasoning or problem-solving.                 |
| **System Property**     |  In systems theory, it is a **property of organized social systems**, such as teams, institutions, or societies, that can perform tasks no individual could do alone. |
| **Epistemic Structure** |  It involves **epistemic infrastructures**, such as classification systems, shared language, roles, and institutional memory, enabling group-level thought.           |

## Structure

| **Functional Role** | **Description**                                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Perception**      | Recognizing other agents, events, norms, and signals in the environment        |
| **Interpretation**  | Applying mental models, schemas, or cultural scripts to make sense of context  |
| **Decision-making** | Choosing among alternatives based on goals, constraints, and expected outcomes |
| **Memory**          | Retaining information about past interactions, norms, or strategies            |
| **Learning**        | Updating behavior or models based on feedback and experience                   |

## Modelling

| **Modeling Layer**             | **Role of Collective Cognition**                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Interaction Unit Level**     | Emerges from interactions between cognitive agents.                                                       |
| **Interaction Level**          | Shaped by communicative acts, coordination, conflict resolution, etc.                                     |
| **State / Property Level**     | Can be a **state** or **property** of a system (e.g., "this team has high shared situational awareness"). |
| **Dynamic / Phenomenon Level** | Appears as a **phenomenon** over time ‚Äî e.g., emergence of consensus, distributed planning.               |

## Collective Cognition

> **Collective Cognition** refers to the emergent, distributed, and coordinated processing of information, interpretation, and decision-making across multiple interaction units (e.g., individuals, groups, organizations). It is both a process and a phenomenon, sustained by communication, shared representations, and epistemic infrastructures.

## üß† vs üßç Individual Cognition

| **Dimension**        | **Individual Cognition** | **Collective Cognition**                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Unit of Analysis** | One mind                 | A coordinated system of minds (and tools) |
| **Memory**           | Biological, internal     | Distributed, institutional, technological |
| **Decision-making**  | Intrapersonal            | Interpersonal / group-based               |
| **Dynamics**         | Neural / psychological   | Social, communicative, systemic           |
