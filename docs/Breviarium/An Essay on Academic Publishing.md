- Quality Assurance of the System of Quality Assurance

## Real Time Process

> There is not internval publicacion or agenda; it's an online process. At the final of the years or silos a compendium can and shoulb be publish.

> Allow for many types of documents; including some essays; etc.

## Reviewer Performance Tracking and Recognition\

> Reviewers should get a score — if the scoring system is fair, multi-dimensional, confidential by default, and embedded in a feedback-oriented framework. Done right, this strengthens the entire peer review system.

> For the score;  use a lot of agregated adta; and create multiople scoring models; in an outside sysetm.  with capacity for integrating to other external system to conduct the scoring.

> It's not for normation; just singal processing for people.

> Ther eshould always be a score market; scores are not there to judge; just a process signal; for people. If they become a metric they will be gamed.

Maintain profiles of reviewers with meta-review scores and feedback history.

Use these profiles to:

- Select high-quality reviewers preferentially.
- Identify reviewers needing training or removal.
- Publicly acknowledge exemplary reviewers.

## Incentive System for Reviewrs

- Non-monetary incentives: Recognition on platforms like Publons, reviewer certificates, discounts on open access fees, or editorial board invitations.
- Credits or tokens: Systems that accumulate credits to “pay” for future submissions or editorial services.
- Micro-payments or stipends: Small honoraria for reviews, possibly funded by grants or institutions.
- Improved career incentives: Institutions valuing peer review as a recognized metric for hiring, promotion, and funding.

### Principles


Got it — you're asking for **principles for building a quality assurance system** for scientific publications, not just general advice for individual researchers.

Here are core **design principles** to build a robust, scalable, and trustworthy **Quality Assurance System for Science Publications** (QASSP):

---

## 🏗️ **Principles for Building a Quality Assurance System for Science Publications**

### 1. **Multi-Level Validation Architecture**

* Implement **layered review processes**, such as:

  * **Technical checks** (data availability, formatting, reproducibility)
  * **Peer review** (expert judgment on methodology, novelty, and impact)
  * **Post-publication review** (open or moderated public scrutiny)
* Include **domain-specific validators** (statistical reviewers, ethical compliance officers, software/code reviewers).

---

### 2. **Standardization of Scientific Reporting**

* Enforce the use of **structured formats and reporting guidelines**:

  * CONSORT, PRISMA, STROBE, ARRIVE, etc.
* Use **machine-readable metadata** to ensure interoperability and downstream usage.
* Mandate **data dictionaries**, **method schemas**, and **explicit operational definitions**.

---

### 3. **Automated and Semi-Automated Quality Checks**

* Integrate tools for:

  * **Plagiarism detection**
  * **Statistical consistency checking**
  * **Code execution/reproducibility validation**
  * **Reference accuracy audits**
* Use AI/ML to flag anomalies but ensure **human oversight**.

---

### 4. **Transparency and Auditability**

* Maintain **version control** for submissions, peer reviews, and editorial decisions.
* Make **review histories** and **editorial justifications** transparent (even if anonymized).
* Create **audit logs** for all modifications post-submission.

---

### 5. **Reproducibility and Data Integrity**

* Require authors to deposit:

  * **Raw data**
  * **Codebases with environment specifications (e.g., Docker, Conda)**
  * **Pre-registration records**
* Use independent replication committees or reproducibility consortia.

---

### 6. **Reviewer Accountability and Incentives**

* Evaluate reviewers' performance via **metrics of rigor, constructiveness, and timeliness**.
* Credit reviewers via platforms like **Publons**, ORCID integration, or journal acknowledgments.
* Implement **reviewer training programs** on ethics, bias awareness, and critical methodology.

---

### 7. **Bias Detection and Mitigation**

* Track and mitigate biases in:

  * **Review assignments** (gender, institution, geographic)
  * **Acceptance rates across topics or disciplines**
* Use **blinded** or **double-blind** review when appropriate.
* Monitor **language quality** to ensure it does not become a gatekeeping mechanism.

---

### 8. **Feedback and Post-Publication Mechanisms**

* Provide channels for:

  * **Corrections**
  * **Community comments**
  * **Re-analyses or rebuttals**
* Maintain **living papers** (versionable documents that can be updated with consensus).

---

### 9. **Governance and Ethical Oversight**

* Establish an independent **Ethics and Integrity Board** with enforcement powers.
* Monitor for:

  * **Conflicts of interest**
  * **Manipulation or fraud**
  * **Dual use or harmful misapplications**
* Publicly list **retractions**, **bans**, and **sanctions** with rationale.

---

### 10. **Global Standards and Interoperability**

* Align with initiatives like:

  * **COPE**, **DOAJ**, **CrossRef**, **Open Science Framework**
* Ensure compatibility across **national**, **disciplinary**, and **language boundaries**.
* Promote **open APIs** for indexing and transparency across platforms.

Got it! You’re outlining a vision for a **transparent, open, and fair review system** with features like random reviewer assignment, open commenting (at least by reviewers), full public visibility, and annotated data that’s indicative (informative) rather than prescriptive (normative). Here’s how that could look as a set of principles and core design ideas:

---

## Principles & Features for a Transparent & Indicative Open Review System

### 1. **Randomized Reviewer Assignment**

* Assign reviewers randomly (or semi-randomly with minimal constraints) to reduce bias and gatekeeping.
* Use algorithms that ensure diversity and prevent conflicts of interest.
* Track assignment history transparently.

### 2. **Open Review Process**

* Reviews are visible publicly alongside the paper.
* Reviewers can comment openly, but only reviewers (or designated experts) can post official reviews.
* Comments from the public (non-reviewers) can be allowed but marked separately or moderated.

### 3. **Full Public Visibility**

* Publish all versions of the manuscript, including revisions.
* Publish all review reports and comments.
* Publish editor decisions, timelines, and review histories.
* Provide open access to supplementary materials, data, and code.

### 4. **Indicative, Not Normative, System**

* Reviews and comments serve as **indications of quality, confidence, and consensus**, not hard acceptance/rejection rules.
* Readers interpret reviews as guidance to inform their own judgment.
* Authors can respond publicly to reviews to foster dialogue.

### 5. **Annotation and Metadata Layer**

* Implement an open annotation system that links comments, corrections, and discussions directly to manuscript sections or figures.
* Enable structured metadata tagging for:

  * Conflict of interest declarations
  * Data availability
  * Ethical approvals
  * Funding sources
* Annotations help users navigate and interpret complex documents transparently.

### 6. **Transparent Metrics and Dashboards**

* Show live, real-time metrics like:

  * Number of reviewers
  * Review lengths and thoroughness
  * Reviewer agreement/disagreement signals
* Avoid impact factor–style metrics; instead, show diverse indicators (altmetrics, reproducibility badges, etc.).

### 7. **Governance & Moderation**

* An open community governance model for dispute resolution and moderation.
* Minimal censorship, emphasizing **freedom of speech balanced with respect and professionalism**.
* Clear policies on handling misconduct.

### 8. **Open Data and Tools**

* All review data and annotations are openly accessible for meta-research.
* Provide APIs for third parties to build tools on top of review data (recommendation engines, quality filters).

### Hide Reviews Until All Reviers Publish Their Studies

> ...

### How many reviewrs should be assign to a study?

- Assign 2–3 qualified reviewers for standard manuscripts.
- Adjust reviewer number upward for complex, high-impact, or controversial work.
- Use post-publication and community review to broaden quality assurance beyond initial reviewers.

## Random Post-Quality Review

> . Random Sampling for Meta-Review Audit

- From all completed reviews, a random sample of review reports is selected periodically (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
- Sample size determined by journal workload and resources (e.g., 5-10% of reviews).
- Random selection is weighted toward flagged reviews (e.g., contradictory reviews, very short reviews, or flagged by editors).



### Paid Reviewers

> ...

### Design the Review Workflow

> Make this process hideen in an optinal way.

Define:

- Submission process
- Review stages: Single/double-blind? Internal/external? Sequential or parallel?
- Feedback loops: Does the author revise based on reviews?
- Decision rules: Who makes the final call?

### Develop Review Instruments

These can include:

- Scorecards or rubrics
- Narrative feedback forms
- Reviewer checklists
- Benchmark examples for each score level

### Incorporate Quality Assurance

- Inter-rater reliability checks (e.g., Cohen’s kappa)
- Meta-review or oversight panels
- Spot audits on random reviews
- Use post-review surveys to assess fairness and usefulness


### Monitor and Evolve the System

- Track review time, satisfaction, consistency.
- Review the system annually.
- Use feedback to update criteria or training.

## Efficiency Metrics

For an **academic publishing organization**, efficiency metrics should reflect how effectively the organization converts **inputs** (e.g., submissions, editorial labor, reviewer time, funding) into **high-quality academic output** (e.g., published articles, citations, reputation). Here’s a targeted framework:

---

## 📐 Efficiency Metrics for Academic Publishing Organizations

### 🔄 **1. Submission-to-Publication Efficiency**

Measures speed and throughput of the editorial process.

* **Acceptance Rate** = Accepted Submissions / Total Submissions
  *Signals selectivity and editorial efficiency.*

* **Average Time to First Decision**
  *Indicates how quickly initial feedback is delivered.*

* **Average Time to Publication** = (Final Publication Date – Submission Date)
  *Measures end-to-end publishing pipeline efficiency.*

* **Manuscript Throughput** = Published Articles / Editor or Staff FTE
  *Articles handled per staff member; operational load.*

---

### 💰 **2. Cost Efficiency**

Links publishing output to budget/resources.

* **Cost per Article** = Total Publishing Costs / Articles Published
  *Core financial efficiency metric.*

* **Revenue per Article** = Total Revenue / Articles Published
  *Important for subscription or APC-based models.*

* **Reviewer Efficiency** = Reviews Completed / Reviewer Pool Size
  *Can indicate strain or balance in peer review system.*

---

### 📈 **3. Impact Efficiency**

Connects output to scholarly impact and prestige.

* **Citation Efficiency** = Total Citations / Articles Published
  *Normalized impact metric.*

* **Altmetric Efficiency** = Altmetric Score / Article
  *Captures social & media engagement per output.*

* **Impact Factor per \$ Spent** = Journal Impact Factor / Operating Budget
  *Rare but revealing ratio of cost to prestige.*

---

### 🧰 **4. Platform & Technical Efficiency**

  *Should be >99.9% for digital platforms.*

* **Submission Drop-Off Rate** = (Started – Completed Submissions) / Started
  *Can indicate UX or process friction.*

* **Editorial Platform Load Time** = Avg. Seconds per Action
  *Direct impact on user productivity.*

---

### 🤝 **5. Stakeholder Satisfaction**

Useful for balancing efficiency with quality.

* **Author Satisfaction Score** (survey-based)
* **Reviewer Retention Rate** = Returning Reviewers / Total Reviewers
* **Editor Load Index** = Manuscripts Assigned / Editors
  *Helps detect burnout or overload.*
