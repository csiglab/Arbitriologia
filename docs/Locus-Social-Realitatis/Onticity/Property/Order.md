# Social Order

> In this note, we explore the concept of Social Order, examining it as a property of social configurations that captures patterns of stability, coordination, and predictability within social systems.

QA:

- How can we identify the dynamics that generate and sustain **social order**?
- How can we identify the dynamics that produce **social disorder**?

## Ontology

> Social order is a **complex property** of a given configuration of a social field that captures the patterns of stability, coordination, and predictability emerging from the interactions of agents and institutions. It does not exist independently as a discrete entity but is instantiated through the structure and dynamics of the social configuration.

## Structure

> What is the structure of the property?

| Dimension                   | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stability**               | Measures the resilience of the social configuration to internal or external changes; reflects how persistent norms, institutions, and behaviors are over time. |
| **Coordination**            | Captures the degree to which agents’ behaviors are aligned to achieve collective outcomes, through norms, rules, or shared expectations.                       |
| **Predictability**          | Reflects how foreseeable behaviors and social outcomes are, given the existing structure of interactions and institutional rules.                              |
| **Acceptance** | Indicates the degree to which the property is recognized, endorsed, and sustained by agents within the social configuration.                                   |
| **Adaptability**            | Represents the capacity of the social order to accommodate change, innovation, or disruptions while maintaining systemic coherence.                            |
| **Embeddedness**            | Describes the extent to which the social order is rooted in institutional arrangements, cultural norms, and recurring interaction patterns.                    |

## Comparison

> What are the possible values of these properties, and how can they be systematically classified into a typology?

| Social Order Dimension      | Democracy (e.g., Sweden, Canada)                                 | Authoritarian / Dictatorship (e.g., North Korea, Pinochet Chile)       | Fragile / Anarchic System (e.g., Somalia 1990s)                   |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stability**               | Medium–High: Stable institutions, peaceful transitions of power. | High: Stability enforced through coercion and repression.              | Low: Weak institutions, frequent disruptions.                     |
| **Coordination**            | Medium: Coordination through rules, negotiation, and norms.      | High: Top-down enforcement of behavior.                                | Low: Minimal alignment among agents.                              |
| **Predictability**          | Medium–High: Predictable legal and political frameworks.         | High: Predictable outcomes due to strict control.                      | Low: Outcomes highly uncertain.                                   |
| **Legitimacy / Acceptance** | High: Broad public acceptance through participation.             | Medium–Low: Compliance often coerced; legitimacy limited.              | Low: Little consensus or recognition of authority.                |
| **Adaptability**            | High: Capable of absorbing social and political changes.         | Low: Resistant to change; brittle under stress.                        | Medium–Low: Local adaptation occurs, but systemic coherence weak. |
| **Embeddedness**            | High: Deeply rooted in institutions, norms, and culture.         | Medium: Limited institutional or cultural rooting; relies on coercion. | Low: Weak institutional or normative roots.                       |
