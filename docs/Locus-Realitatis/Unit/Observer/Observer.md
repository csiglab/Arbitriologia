# Observer

> An Observer is any entity or process that perceives, records, or interprets the behavior or structure of a system. In social theory and systems thinking, observers are not neutralâ€”they are embedded within the system and their observations shape, constrain, or constitute the system.

## Internal Observer

> Note: When we refer to an observer in a social system; is basicaly a critical mass of infucluencial acotrs in the system.

> An Internal Observer is an observer that is part of the system it observes. It has limited perspective and interacts with the systemâ€™s dynamics.

- In cybernetics (esp. second-order), the internal observer is reflexive.
- Cannot access a total view of the system.
- Is shaped by the systemâ€™s feedback loops and regulatory structures.
- Observations are perspectival, partial, and performative.

## ðŸ”„ Recursive Observation

> Observers can observe other observers, or even themselves â€” a principle in second-order cybernetics.

> This leads to meta-level reasoning, institutional reflexivity, and recursive design.

## Case Studies

- International organizations assessing national development.
- Researchers modeling a society without lived immersion.

## QA

> What underlies the changes inthe cognitive schema of some observer in social systems realited to country position with respect to other socieites?
