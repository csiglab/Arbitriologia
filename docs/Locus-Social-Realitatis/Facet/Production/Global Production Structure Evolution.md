# Global Production Structure Evolution

> What can humanity do, and what technologies power it?

> From the earliest stone tools to the intricate networks of global supply chains, humanity’s production structure has continuously evolved in response to environmental challenges, technological discoveries, and social organization. In the beginning, production was simple, local, and rooted in subsistence—centered on hunting, gathering, and rudimentary tool-making. As human societies grew more complex, so did their methods of production: agriculture, metallurgy, craftsmanship, industrial machinery, and eventually digital automation. This long arc of transformation reveals not only how humans meet their material needs, but also how they organize labor, accumulate knowledge, and shape civilization itself.
