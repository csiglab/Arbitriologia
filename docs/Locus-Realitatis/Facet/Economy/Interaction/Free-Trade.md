# Free Trade

: 10

> The best analysis of "free trade" was actually written in the late 19th century by the American political economist **Henry George**. This book was read into the Congressional Record by a number of Congressmen and mailed to millions of their constituents. Although Henry George championed the ability of people to trade with one another across borders, he warned that the potential benefits of free trade would be significantly reduced because of others laws and taxation policies that protected "rentier" interests (i.e., those who produced nothing but because they controlled land and natural resources were able to charge others "rent" for the mere right of access). Thus, George called for the elimination of all taxation, except for an annual tax on the potential rental value of land (and land-like assets, such as the broadcast spectrum).
