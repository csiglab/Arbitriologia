# Economic Reality

> An **economy** is a network of interacting agents: individuals, firms, gov agencies and R & D agents that engage in performing action from their action space using a set of public goods  enablers.

> **"Economy"** is a troublesome word because we use it colloquially to refer to the market economy we're familiar with today, and its various studied trappings - rational actors, market equilibrium, macroeconomic policies, etc. But so much of it consists of socially constructed elements - ownership, dealmaking, invention, regulation, taxation, etc. - that an economic model is always a form of interpretation, an attempt to confine a
lot of **chaotic** and **inconsistent forces** into something more apparently orderly.

## Ontology (The Observed)

> Note: **(Intermediate)** indicates an intermediate ontological abstraction introduced to improve the conceptual and ontological scaffold.

> Note: The distinction between ontological and epistemological elements is not always clear-cut — as in the case of information, which can belong to both layers depending on context. These divisions should therefore be taken with a grain of salt.

> Note: Agents use their epistemic frameworks — including beliefs, expectations, and interpretations — to perceive reality and make decisions.

## Epistemology  (Observer)

> Note: By epistemology, we refer to the epistemic dimension — that is, anything related to knowledge, belief, justification, and the processes by which agents understand, interpret, or evaluate reality.

> **Note**: Consider the cognitive state of an observer as the state of their brain at a given time t. This cognitive state can itself be regarded as an ontological element, as it exists in reality and interacts with it. The observer’s epistemic state and the ontological reality it perceives are therefore deeply intertwined, forming a unity often described as the mind-body or episteme-ontology relationship.

> Internal Observer: First-person perspective monitoring one's own mental processes and experiences.

> External Observer: Third-person perspective examining cognitive processes from outside the system.

## Causality

> The principle that events (causes) produce other events (effects), forming the basis for understanding relationships and mechanisms in the world.

## Modality

> Modality refers to the mode, manner, or degree by which propositions, events, or states are represented as possible, necessary, contingent, or impossible. It captures the ways in which reality—or statements about reality—are qualified with respect to certainty, obligation, capability, or hypotheticality.
