# Interaction Unit

> Ontological element that represents Actors (individuals, groups, basic or compound).

## Behavioral Schema

> Note: This behavioral model—or more precisely, this assumption about the Interaction Unit—is pervasive in economics.

> A formalized model of goal-oriented behavior: it specifies what the unit is optimizing.
