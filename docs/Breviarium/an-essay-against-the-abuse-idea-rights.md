# En Essay Against the Abuse of the Idea of Rights

Key Questions:

- What is rights inflation, and how does it manifest in contemporary societies?
- What constitutes a system of rights, and how are its components structured?
- How should overlapping or interdependent rights be managed? What are the underlying dependencies within a rights system?
- Is there a theoretical or practical limit to the number or scope of rights a society can recognize without generating contradictions?
- How should states prioritize rights when conflicts arise, or when resources are constrained?
- Does framing all individual desires as rights create moral hazard or diminish personal responsibility?

## Case Study: Argentina

## Conclusion

> The inflation of rights carries the risk of trivializing fundamental entitlements, creating social conflict, and overburdening institutions. While societies should remain responsive to new forms of social claim, the distinction between “rights” and “desires” must be preserved to sustain the conceptual integrity, enforceability, and societal value of rights.
