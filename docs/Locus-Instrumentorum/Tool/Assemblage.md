# Assemblage-Theoretic Modelling Framework

> ...

## I. **Ontological Commitments**

1. **Assemblages** as the fundamental units:  * No unified "society"â€”only assemblages (e.g., families, firms, networks, institutions).
2. **Realism**:   * Social systems exist independently of observers and are causally efficacious.
3. **Non-totalization**:  * Avoids holistic or reductionist accounts (e.g., not society as a super-organism, nor only individual actions).

## II. **Core Concepts**

| Concept                                       | Description                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Assemblage**                                | A composition of heterogeneous elements (human, technical, symbolic) that form a functional whole. |
| **Relations of Exteriority**                  | Components can be detached and reassembled elsewhere; identity is not essential.                   |
| **Territorialization / Deterritorialization** | Stabilizing vs. destabilizing forces acting on an assemblage.                                      |
| **Material vs. Expressive Roles**             | Distinction between physical and symbolic or regulatory components.                                |
| **Emergence**                                 | System properties not reducible to components, arising from interaction patterns.                  |
| **Intensive Variables**                       | Non-metric drivers like pressure (conflict), temperature (intensity of discourse), etc.            |
| **Phase Space & Attractors**                  | Abstract space of all possible states and typical behavioral tendencies.                           |

## III. **Modelling Dimensions**

| Dimension             | Operationalization                                                          |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scale**             | Micro (individual), Meso (groups/orgs), Macro (institutions, states).       |
| **Temporality**       | Short-term dynamics, long-term evolution, historical contingency.           |
| **Stability**         | Degree of territorialization (e.g., codified laws vs. informal norms).      |
| **Connectivity**      | Network structure: nodes (actors/institutions), links (flows/interactions). |
| **Power Dynamics**    | Flow of resources, control mechanisms, regime maintenance or disruption.    |
| **Information Flows** | Communication, representation, discourse (expressive roles).                |

## IV. **Methodological Toolkit**

| Tool                                | Purpose                                                             |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent-Based Modelling (ABM)**     | Simulate emergence from interaction of heterogeneous agents.        |
| **Dynamical Systems Models**        | Model attractors, bifurcations, and stability zones.                |
| **Network Analysis**                | Map and measure connectivity, centrality, clustering, etc.          |
| **Qualitative Assemblage Mapping**  | Identify components and their roles (material/expressive).          |
| **Comparative Historical Analysis** | Explore how different configurations led to divergent trajectories. |

## V. **Example Use Case: Urban System**

* **Assemblage**: A city.
* **Components**: Infrastructure (material), legal frameworks (expressive), residents, businesses.
* **Territorialization**: Zoning laws, traffic norms.
* **Deterritorialization**: Migration, informal settlements, protest movements.
* **Dynamics**: Traffic flow patterns, housing market bubbles (emergent from micro-decisions).
* **Simulatable with**: ABMs for mobility, GIS + networks for spatial-economic flows.

## VI. **Advantages of the Framework**

* Respects **heterogeneity** and **multiplicity**.
* Avoids essentialism and overgeneralization.
* Enables both **qualitative depth** and **quantitative formalization**.
* Aligns with **scientific realism**, especially in its treatment of causality and emergence.
