If an economy imports every machine tool it needs, and lacks any localization can growth and develop

Well value add is technology; but technology is not only embeded in the device; the technical knowledge needed to complement tue device in production; is a great source of value add; machines only take you that far.

So yes; If you don't have any capacity to produce any machine; technology is much more than the capacity to create machines; but its really a hojo ciego;  that does not help eighter;.

> No machine tool production capacity;  does not means superficial industrialization.

If an economy **imports all its machine tools** and **lacks localization (i.e., no domestic capability to produce, adapt, or maintain industrial technology)**, it **can grow**, but **its development will be fragile, dependent, and limited in depth**. Here's a breakdown:

‚ùó But Here's the Catch:

- A total lack of domestic machine tool capacity does limit long-term autonomy.

- Even if it‚Äôs not needed for depth, it matters for sovereignty:

- In crises (wars, sanctions, pandemics), you may lose access.

- Upstream control is critical in defense, aerospace, and strategic industries.

- Over time, lack of even minimal machine tool R&D can hollow out technical ecosystems.

## Industry -> Technical Knowledge Nature

> Here‚Äôs a cleaner, clearer version that highlights the relationship between industry and the nature of technical knowledge, while maintaining a structured, readable format:

### üõ† Machine-Driven Industries
