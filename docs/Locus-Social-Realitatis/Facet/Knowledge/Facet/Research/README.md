# Knowledge Production System (KPS)

> The Knowledge Production System is a compound interaction-regulation system composed of recursive interaction units and layered mechanisms of validation, reproduction, and symbolic control over truth claims. It is deeply embedded in and co-evolves with its environment (culture, economy, polity).

## Taxonomy

> How to classify research?

- Purporse: Why the research is conducted?
- Metdhology:  How knowledge is produced?
- By Orientation - Epistemic Goal - **Research Maturity**: What kind of knowledge is sought?
  - Basic: Aims at understanding principles, laws, or mechanisms.
  - Apply: Targets practical problems using existing or new knowledge.
  - Translational: Bridges basic knowledge and applied implementation (common in biomedical and engineering contexts).
  - Action-Oriented: Research conducted within the process of intervention (e.g., action research).
- Object of Study:  What kind of inquiry object is studied?

## 🔁 Key Ontological Functions

- Production → Generation of new symbols, models, theories, and explanations
- Validation → Establishment of truth, reliability, and validity via epistemic protocols
- Reproduction → Training and credentialing of knowledge producers
- Diffusion → Circulation of knowledge through networks and infrastructure
- Boundary Management → Differentiating disciplines, legitimate knowledge, and "pseudoscience

## Interaction

- Diffusion
- Commercialization
- Knowledge Brokerage
- Human Capital Formation
