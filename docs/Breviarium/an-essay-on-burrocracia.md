# An Essay on 'Burrocracia'

TO BE DONE

Burocracia (Buracratic Absurdities):

- In some societies there is procedure - after procedure to check the previosu procedure, etc. India, Brazil, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Keqiang
- Li was critical of unnecessary government bureaucracy, particularly at 
the grassroots level. He stated his belief that many lower-level 
officials fail to provide services to the public in an effective manner.
 Regarding his disdain for the matter, Li's many quotable anecdotes have
 become viral. In May 2015, Li referred to a case in which a citizen 
filling out a form to travel overseas (normal in the PRC) had to write 
down an emergency contact (the citizen put down their mother as the 
contact), and the government official overseeing the matter asked the 
citizen to provide a notarized document to "prove your mom is your mom."[[133]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Keqiang#cite_note-mom-134)
 Li called this incident "absolutely preposterous". In another case, he 
referred to a grassroots civil servant who asked for proof that a 
one-year old does not have a criminal record in order to deliver a 
government service.[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Keqiang#cite_note-cnews-135)
 In yet another case, Li referred to a senior citizen applying for 
welfare benefits being forced by government employees to provide proof 
that "they are still alive." Regarding the latter two incidents, Li 
said, "this is not a joke, it's all real!"[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Keqiang#cite_note-cnews-135)
