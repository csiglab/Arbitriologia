# External Observer

> Exovidente - exo- (fuera) + vidente - Neologismo.

> This space encompasses the full spectrum of inquiry and analysis aimed at understanding and addressing complex policy and institutional challenges. It integrates methods, frameworks, and tools to generate knowledge that informs effective decision-making and innovation.

> Note: We used instruments and frameworks to observe, measure, and model reality with rigor and clarity.

> **Observation**: From Phenomena of the System → via Instruments → to Models.

> Act as an external observer to analyze social reality.

> Remember: The position of a researcher is that of an external observer. Be explicit about the observer’s position to properly localize reflexivity.

## Meta Ontological Framework

> An **ontology** is a formal and systematic representation of concepts, categories, and relationships within a particular domain of knowledge.

> aka. Second Order Ontology.

> Remember: The position of a researcher is that of an external observer. Be explicit about the observer’s position to properly localize reflexivity.

> A Meta-Ontological Framework is a structured system for defining, organizing, and relating the fundamental building blocks of social reality. It operates at a higher level of abstraction than domain ontologies, providing the rules, categories, and compositional logic through which social entities and processes are identified, classified, and constructed.

> This framework serves as a meta-structural foundation for modeling, simulating, and analyzing complex social systems — such as institutions, cities, power structures, roles, norms, and identities — in a rigorous and composable way.

> This enables rigorous modeling, comparison, and reasoning about social phenomena at multiple levels of abstraction.

## Conceptual Framework

> Social sciences study dynamic, **multi-agent systems** composed of human actors interacting within environments, giving rise to emergent forms of social organization, and transformation.

> **Social reality** refers to the shared world of meanings, norms, institutions, and practices that arise from human interactions and shape our perception of what is “real” or “true” within a social context. It is constructed collectively through language, symbols, and social agreements, giving structure and order to social life beyond individual subjectivity.

> **Social reality** is **observed and analyze** and organized through conceptualizations of actors and their interactions, embedded within structured environments of norms, meanings, power relations, and emergent systemic patterns.

## Fundamental Abstraction to Represent Social Reality

> **Social Reality** refers to the shared world of meanings, norms, institutions, and practices that arise from human interactions and shape our perception of what is “real” or “true” within a social context. It is constructed collectively through language, symbols, and social agreements, giving structure and order to social life beyond individual subjectivity.

> 🧠 We propose a framework to aid an external observer in parsing social reality. Note that reflexivity is not included here because it is considered an inherent feature of the Interaction Units. This framework is structured based on the fundamental ontological elements of reality and the epistemic constructs—derived conceptual structures built from these ontological building blocks—that an external observer employs to interpret them.

> Note: Interaction ⊆ Process — interaction is a specialized kind of process centered on relational events between actors.

> Note:  Agency-Structure Duality: Social reality is shaped by the dynamic interplay between **agents** (Interaction Units) who exercise agency—the capacity to act, make choices, and influence—and the **structures**—norms, rules, institutions—that both constrain and enable those actions. This duality means that while agents produce and reproduce social structures through their interactions, those structures simultaneously shape agents’ possibilities and behaviors, creating a continuous recursive loop central to social dynamics.

### Epistemic Properties of Social Reality

| Property                    | Description                                                                                    | Case Study                                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Relationality**           | Social reality is fundamentally constituted by relationships among actors and units.           | Interactions, social networks, roles            |
| **Emergence**               | Macro-level patterns arise from micro-level interactions but cannot be fully reduced to them.  | Institutions, norms, culture                    |
| **Multi-level Structure**   | Social reality exists at multiple nested levels (individual, group, organizational, societal). | Families → communities → states                 |
| **Reflexivity**             | Actors can reflect on, interpret, and modify their own behavior and the social context.        | Self-awareness, cultural adaptation             |
| **Normativity**             | Social reality is shaped by norms, rules, and shared expectations that regulate behavior.      | Laws, customs, etiquette                        |
| **Dynamism**                | Social reality is in constant flux, shaped by ongoing interactions and changes over time.      | Social movements, changing institutions         |
| **Symbolic Meaning**        | Meaning and interpretation are central; social reality is constructed through shared symbols.  | Language, rituals, ideologies                   |
| **Context-dependence**      | Social phenomena depend heavily on cultural, historical, economic, and environmental contexts. | Norms varying by culture or period              |
| **Power Relations**         | Social reality includes asymmetries of power influencing interactions and structures.          | Authority, inequality, dominance                |
| **Co-construction**         | Social reality is jointly constructed through interaction and shared understanding.            | Negotiation of meaning, collective identity     |
| **Institutionalization**    | Social patterns become stabilized and formalized into institutions and structures.             | Governments, legal systems, educational systems |
| **Materiality**             | Social reality has material aspects and is embedded in physical environments and technologies. | Infrastructure, technology, artifacts           |
| **Uncertainty & Ambiguity** | Social reality often involves ambiguity, multiple interpretations, and unpredictability.       | Conflicting norms, contested meanings           |

### Observer Pitfalls

> aka. Epistemic Pitfalls.

| **Pitfall**              | **Description**                                                                                            | **Typical Symptom**                                                                                                  | **Mitigation Tactic**                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Observer Projection**  | Imposing the analyst’s own categories onto actors, mistaking external description for lived experience.    | Concepts that resonate in the report but are unrecognized or rejected by the subjects studied.                       | Deploy **participant verification** (member checking) and **positionality statements**.                                   |
| **Reification Fallacy**  | Treating conceptual abstractions (e.g., “Regulation”, “Emergence”) as concrete objects with causal powers. | Sentences like “Institutions drive behavior” without specifying *which* actors interpret, enact, or subvert them.    | Operationalize abstractions into observable interaction patterns + boundary conditions.                                   |
| **Level Confusion**      | Slipping between micro, meso, and macro accounts without explicit aggregation rules.                       | Explanations that attribute macro-level outcomes (e.g., inflation) solely to micro motives (e.g., individual greed). | Use **explicit aggregation protocols**: specify *how* micro interactions are scaled or *how* macro constraints feed back. |
| **Static Snapshots**     | Freezing dynamic processes into fixed typologies, masking ongoing negotiation and drift.                   | Phenomena classified as “stabilized” even while actors report escalating contestation.                               | Schedule repeated measurements; add **temporal tagging** to every state description.                                      |
| **Selective Attention**  | Highlighting data that fit the chosen lens while ignoring disconfirming evidence.                          | Smooth theoretical curves drawn through noisy or contradictory field data.                                           | Pre-register analytical focus; use **triangulation** (quantitative, qualitative, participatory).                          |
| **Reflexive Blind Spot** | Failure to account for the analyst’s own influence on the system (especially in participatory settings).   | Subjects alter behavior because observation is known; findings portray “natural” behavior.                           | Integrate **second-order observation** (observe the observation process itself) and log feedback loops.                   |

### Ontological Primitives of Social Reality

> Note: Regulation as a shared protocol between Interaction Units;it can be consider emergent; and not really a primitive buildign block; but this is a fronteir; so lets treated like a bulding block.

> Note: A **social process** is a sequence or pattern of relational events and interactions among Interaction Units that collectively produce, reproduce, or transform social structures and realities over time. Social processes encompass communication, cooperation, conflict, adaptation, and other dynamic activities through which social order emerges and evolves.

> Note (Property): This is basically a tag.

### Interaction Unit

> An **Interaction Unit** is the fundamental cognitive and social actor or entity that participates in and generates relational events within a social system. It serves as the primary locus of agency and meaning-making in social interactions.

**Feature**:

| Feature                   | Description                                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Agentive Entity**       | Can be individual, group, organization, or compound social actor with intentional action.              |
| **Cognitive Capacity**    | Possesses internal reflexivity enabling self-observation, interpretation, and behavioral adaptation.   |
| **Relational Focus**      | Engages in interactions such as communication, cooperation, competition, and conflict.                 |
| **Nested & Scalable**     | Can be atomic (individual) or compound (group, institution), supporting multi-level analysis.          |
| **Boundary**              | Has definable conceptual or physical boundaries distinguishing it from others and the environment.     |
| **Behavioral Repertoire** | Holds a set of possible actions, strategies, or roles constrained by norms, capabilities, and context. |
| **State & Attributes**    | Maintains an internal state or status that evolves through interactions and influences behavior.       |
| **Reflexivity**           | Internal capacity for self-reference, learning, and modifying future behavior (intrinsic to unit).     |

**Levels:**

### Regulation

> Regulation refers to the system of norms, rules, and institutional constraints that guide and shape the behavior of Interaction Units within a social system.

It embodies a dual character:

- As a building block, regulation constitutes the structural and often codified protocols—formal laws, policies, or informal customs—that serve as fundamental constraints and enablers of social interaction.

- As an emergent phenomenon, regulation arises dynamically from the repeated interactions of agents, reflecting collectively constructed, maintained, and negotiated shared understandings and practices. These emergent norms evolve over time through social processes such as enforcement, adaptation, and contestation.

In this framework, regulation is thus both a foundational ontological element providing the scaffolding for social order and a fluid, epistemic construct continually (re)produced by Interaction Units as shared protocols for coordination and governance.

### Environemnt

> Note: Social phenomena are frequently recursive and multilayered. In this context, we focus on **geography and natural resources** as the most fundamental environment.
'
> A **Derivative Environment** is a secondary or higher-order context that emerges from, depends upon, or is shaped by a more fundamental environment (such as geography). It encompasses social, economic, cultural, institutional, informational, temporal, or cognitive layers that influence and frame human interactions and social phenomena.

### Phenomena (State Change) (Dynamics)

> A **phenomenon** is a **structured trajectory** of state tag transformations (e.g., power, trust, legitimacy, resource allocation), arising from interaction processes, under specific rules, feedback mechanisms, and boundary conditions.

### Property

> In ontology, a property is a feature, quality, attribute, or characteristic that entities—such as objects, processes, events, or states—can instantiate or possess.

> Most ontological elements can have properties, making them a fundamental means of differentiating, describing, or relating entities within an ontological framework.

### Metaontology

> Metaontology is the study of the nature, purpose, and structure of ontology itself. It addresses foundational questions such as:
What is ontology for? What kinds of things does it postulate? How should we construct or evaluate an ontology?

## Intermediate Ontological &  Analytical Abstraction

> **Secondary Conceptual Scaffolding**: These are mid-level frameworks and categories that organize and structure social phenomena for research and analysis. They build upon foundational concepts by grouping and relating elements like social groups, systems, and environments into coherent layers. This scaffolding supports clearer understanding, comparison, and integration across different scales and domains within the social sciences.

> A **social system** is a bounded, structured set of **recurrent interactions among social agents** (individuals or collectivities) that generate and sustain a pattern of collective behavior, shared meaning, and institutionalized roles through relational, normative, and communicative mechanisms, operating within and upon a material, symbolic, and temporal environment, and exhibiting varying degrees of autonomy, differentiation, self-reference, and adaptive capacity.

> **Culture** is a complex adaptive system comprising interconnected symbols, norms, values, beliefs, and practices that collectively constitute a shared framework of meaning within a social system. It emerges dynamically from the repeated interactions of Interaction Units, who negotiate, reproduce, and modify cultural patterns through social processes. As an emergent phenomenon, culture transcends individual actions yet shapes and constrains them by embedding shared meanings into actors’ cognition and behavior. This reflexive feedback loop enables culture’s persistence, evolution, and its role as both product and producer of social reality.

## Epistemology

> Modelling the Observer.

> The concept of Primitive Epistemological Elements (PEEs) refers to the most fundamental, irreducible building blocks from which all knowledge, justification, and understanding are constructed. They are the "atoms" of epistemology – the starting points that cannot be broken down further or justified by anything more basic within a given epistemological system.

> **Note**: Consider the cognitive state of an observer as the state of their brain at a given time t. This cognitive state can itself be regarded as an ontological element, as it exists in reality and interacts with it. The observer’s epistemic state and the ontological reality it perceives are therefore deeply intertwined, forming a unity often described as the mind-body or episteme-ontology relationship.

| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Constructivism**                           | Knowledge is constructed by observers, not passively received from reality.                           | Models must account for observer perspective and cognitive frames.                                                |
| **Contextuality**                            | Truth and meaning are context-dependent, especially in social domains.                                | Models must be sensitive to cultural, historical, institutional, and linguistic contexts.                         |
| **Reflexivity**                              | Observers and agents are embedded in, and influenced by, the systems they model.                      | Models must incorporate feedback loops between theory, observer, and system behavior, including agent perception. |
| **Inter-subjectivity**                       | Knowledge arises from shared meanings and social interaction.                                         | Modeling must account for communication, norms, and consensus-building mechanisms.                                |
| **Fallibilism**                              | All knowledge is provisional and subject to revision.                                                 | Models should be open-ended, revisable, and explicitly state their limits of validity.                            |
| **Pluralism**                                | Multiple perspectives may coexist and be valid.                                                       | Modeling benefits from multi-paradigm or multi-model approaches.                                                  |
| **Agency and Intentionality**                | Social actors have goals, beliefs, and autonomy.                                                      | Models must reflect purposeful behavior and internal state dynamics.                                              |
| **Emergence**                                | Social phenomena arise from interactions among lower-level agents.                                    | Use bottom-up modeling approaches (e.g. agent-based, cellular automata).                                          |
| **Non-linearity**                            | Cause and effect are not proportional.                                                                | Models must allow for tipping points, thresholds, and feedback-driven dynamics.                                   |
| **Ethical Situatedness / Value-Sensitivity** | Modeling choices embed values and have normative and ethical impacts.                                 | Require explicit value judgments, stakeholder reflection, and ethical considerations in model design and use.     |
| **Operationalization**                       | Concepts must be translated into measurable and observable elements.                                  | Requires mapping abstract theoretical terms into concrete variables or proxies.                                   |
| **Theory-ladenness**                         | Observations are shaped by prior theoretical assumptions.                                             | Models are not “theory-neutral”; conceptual structures influence data and interpretation.                         |
| **Holism vs. Reductionism**                  | Social systems can be approached as wholes or decomposed into parts.                                  | Modeling must justify and clarify the level of abstraction (macro, meso, micro).                                  |
| **Complexity and Uncertainty**               | Social systems are adaptive, nonlinear, and indeterminate.                                            | Models must include mechanisms for uncertainty, unpredictability, and structural change.                          |
| **Historicity / Temporality**                | Social systems evolve through time and history.                                                       | Models must include memory, path-dependence, and evolving trajectories.                                           |
| **Symbolic Mediation**                       | Social life is mediated by symbolic systems (language, money, laws).                                  | Models must account for the construction, transmission, and interpretation of meaning.                            |
| **Multi-level Structure**                    | Systems operate at micro (individual), meso (group), and macro (systemic) levels.                     | Models should represent interactions across these analytical levels.                                              |
| **Representation Fidelity**                  | Models should accurately depict relevant actors, norms, structures, and technologies.                 | Prioritize capturing the system's most salient and influential components.                                        |
| **Dynamic Interaction**                      | Feedback loops and emergent properties arise from agent-structure interplay.                          | Emphasize dynamic relations, causality, and change.                                                               |
| **Adaptation and Learning**                  | Agents and systems evolve through learning and self-organization.                                     | Incorporate mechanisms for updating behavior, adaptation, and evolution.                                          |
| **Embeddedness**                             | Social systems are situated within broader ecological, technological, and institutional environments. | Account for external influences and layered system contexts.                                                      |
| **Openness & Boundary Clarity**              | Systems exchange resources and information with their environment but still require boundaries.       | Define system-environment boundaries explicitly while allowing for interaction.                                   |
| **Heterogeneity**                            | Social systems include diverse agents with varying goals, constraints, and behaviors.                 | Avoid overly uniform or average-agent assumptions.                                                                |
| **Anti-reification**                         | Models should not treat dynamic social constructs as fixed or natural.                                | Emphasize the constructed and changeable nature of social categories and institutions.                            |

### 🧠 Modeling Paradox: Visiviliby - Intelligibility

> aka. Emergence Beyond the Obvious.

> Because social systems are directly observable to the human eye—unlike, for example, molecular systems—this immediacy of observation often leads to a false sense of intelligibility. Yet, at this level of organization, social systems are among the most complex phenomena in existence, due to the presence of adaptation, learning, strategic interaction, and the fact that nearly all meaningful patterns are emergent rather than reducible to simple components.

> Social systems may appear intelligible because they’re visible, but they are fundamentally complex and opaque due to emergent behavior and dynamic learning.
