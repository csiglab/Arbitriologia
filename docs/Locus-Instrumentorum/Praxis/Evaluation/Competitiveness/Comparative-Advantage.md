# Comparative Advantage

> Smith:  **Absolute Advantage** - **Smith** introduced the idea of absolute advantage—that a country should specialize in producing goods it can produce more efficiently (with fewer inputs) than other countries.

> David Ricardo: Ricardo formalized the theory of comparative advantage, using a now-famous example of England and Portugal trading cloth and wine.

- Key Insight: Even if Portugal could produce both wine and cloth more efficiently than England (absolute advantage in both), it still benefits Portugal to specialize in the good where its efficiency advantage is greatest, and trade for the other.

- This was revolutionary because it showed that mutual gains from trade are possible even when one country is better at producing everything.

> John Stuart Mill (mid-1800s) elaborated on reciprocal demand and the terms of trade, improving Ricardo’s theory.

> Eli Heckscher and Bertil Ohlin developed the Heckscher–Ohlin model in the early 20th century, which explained comparative advantage using factor endowments (labor, capital, land).

> Paul Samuelson and others brought rigorous mathematical formalism to the theory, developing models that extended Ricardo's ideas into modern general equilibrium theory.

> “Following a static optimization strategy based on current relative costs in a complex, evolving system will lead to local optima, developmental lock-ins, and systemic fragility. Comparative advantage, if applied naively, generates bad equilibria.”

## Alternatives

- Endogenous capability models: like Hausmann and Hidalgo’s economic complexity or Amsden’s late industrialization theory.
- Systems thinking: tools like system dynamics, agent-based modeling, and complex adaptive systems theory.
- Historical institutionalism: to model the actual co-evolution of state, capital, labor, and technology.
