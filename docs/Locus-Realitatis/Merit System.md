# **Merit System**

> A **Merit System** is a **normative-institutional framework** for allocating roles, resources, and opportunities based on **individual qualifications, performance, or competencies**, rather than on personal relationships, social status, or political favoritism. It aims to ensure fairness, efficiency, and legitimacy in selection, promotion, and reward processes within organizations or broader social systems.
