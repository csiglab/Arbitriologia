# International Trade

: 19

> A trade model is a framework that represents and analyzes the interactions and dynamics of international trade, including factors such as tariffs, quotas, comparative advantage, and market conditions.
> 

> Trade models typically make certain assumptions about the behavior of economic agents and the functioning of markets. They use mathematical equations and formal logic to represent relationships between variables and capture the interactions between countries, industries, and factors of production.

## **Factor Price Equalization**

> "Factor price equalization" refers to the economic principle that in a perfectly competitive market with trade, factors of production (such as labor and capital) will earn the same return across different countries due to the mobility of factors and trade in goods.
> 

> The  **Factor Price Equalization**  price equalization is **not even true** at the level of countries see Spain, Mexico, ….

## Inter-National Trade

## Comparative Advantage

The Scottish economist David Ricardo had an unusual and non-intuitive insight: Two individuals, firms, or countries could benefit from trading with one another even if one were better at everything. Comparative advantage is best seen as an applied opportunity cost: If it has the opportunity to trade, an entity gives up free gains in productivity by not focusing on what it does best.

## International Trade Models

Sure, here are definitions of each trade model you mentioned in one sentence:

1. **Heckscher–Ohlin Model:** This model asserts that countries will export goods that intensively use their abundant factors of production and import goods that use their scarce factors, thereby equalizing factor prices between countries.
2. **Ricardian Model:** This model suggests that countries specialize in producing goods where they have a **comparative advantage**, leading to mutually beneficial trade based on differences in technology or productivity.
3. **Gravity Model:** This model predicts bilateral trade flows between countries based on their economic sizes and the distance between them, assuming larger economies trade more and distance reduces trade.
4. **New Trade Theory:** This model emphasizes economies of scale, product differentiation, and first-mover advantages to explain international trade patterns and the role of government in trade policy.
5. **Ricardo-Viner Model (Specific Factors Model):** This model extends the Ricardian model by considering specific factors of production (e.g., land, labor) that are immobile between industries, leading to redistributive effects of trade within countries.
6. **Monopolistic Competition Model:** This model integrates elements of imperfect competition and product differentiation to explain international trade patterns, emphasizing the role of firms' market power and product diversity in trade.
7. **Factor Proportions Theory:** Also known as the Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson model, it extends the Heckscher-Ohlin model by incorporating factor endowments, technology, and consumer demand to analyze the distributional effects of trade on factors of production within countries.

Each model provides a simplified framework for understanding different aspects of international trade, from comparative advantage to the distributional effects of trade on factors of production.
