# Prediction Market

A Huge Social Technology

> **Prediction markets** are platforms or systems where participants trade financial securities whose values are contingent on the outcome of future events, harnessing collective intelligence to forecast probabilities and outcomes.
> 

Prediction market; the greatest tool for problem solving; not just aggregation and distribution cognition; but an individual and collective one. You can see the thinking of others; etc.

When taking desition prediction; specially hard desition in which there is not a clera method to solve and choose; please you prediction markets.

> Depth of Argument: While enthusiastic, the text could better explain how prediction markets improve decisions (e.g., via incentive alignment, wisdom of crowds) or address common criticisms (e.g., liquidity issues, regulatory barriers).

> Prediction market as a way to use collective intelligence to solve  intractable problems?

> **Note**: Prediction markets work best for forecasting outcomes with clear, **objective resolution criteria** (e.g., 'Will this project meet its technical milestone by 2025?'). Subjective or distant-future outcomes may be harder to verify and could reduce market accuracy.

Uses:

- Prediction markets can improve **R&D decision-making** by allowing stakeholders—such as engineers, scientists, and business strategists—to 'bet' on the success of proposed projects. Participants trade shares tied to outcomes (e.g., technical feasibility or commercial impact), and the resulting market prices aggregate collective intelligence into a probabilistic forecast of each project’s potential. High market confidence signals promising projects worth funding, while low confidence highlights risks or flaws. This method complements traditional review processes by leveraging real-time, data-driven insights from those closest to the work, reducing bias and surfacing hidden expertise. Companies like Google and DARPA have successfully used such systems to prioritize high-impact innovation.
