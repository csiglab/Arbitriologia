| **Phase** | **Description** | **Key Actions and Strategies** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Phase 1: Foundation Building** | We establish basic economic and social infrastructure, focusing on stable governance and basic education. | - Invest in education and healthcare.<br>- Establish legal and regulatory frameworks.<br>- Develop basic infrastructure (roads, electricity). |
| **Phase 2: Industrialization** | We are transitioning from an agricultural to an industrial economy, developing manufacturing capabilities. | - Promote manufacturing and industrial sectors.<br>- Attract foreign direct investment (FDI).<br>- Implement trade policies to support exports. |
| **Phase 3: Diversification** | We are expanding into diverse industries beyond traditional sectors, fostering economic resilience. | - Invest in multiple sectors (technology, services, manufacturing).<br>- Encourage innovation and entrepreneurship.<br>- Strengthen financial institutions. |
| **Phase 4: Innovation and Technology** | Focusing on high-tech industries, research and development, and continuous innovation. | - Increase R&D spending.<br>- Foster partnerships between academia and industry.<br>- Promote digital transformation and advanced technologies. |
| **Phase 5: Sustainable Development** | It is ensuring long-term economic sustainability by integrating environmental and social considerations. | - Implement sustainable practices and policies.<br>- Invest in green technologies.<br>- Promote inclusive growth and social equity. |
