# Technology

> Technology is the practical application of scientific and technical knowledge to create tools, systems, and processes that solve problems, extend human capabilities, or enable new functions.

> Technology involves the application of conceptual knowledge to achieve practical goals, especially in a reproducible manner. The term can also refer to the products resulting from these efforts, including both tangible tools such as utensils or machines, and intangible ones like software. Technology plays a critical role in science, engineering, and everyday life.

> Note: A working definition of technology for industrial policy is based on the technical knowledge needed to achieve goals. Everything else are technical objects.

## Technical Knowledge

"This paper examines the radar system not simply as a piece of technology, but as a technical object in the Simondonian sense—an individuated entity that mediates between domains of technical knowledge and epistemic frameworks. We explore how radar not only performs surveillance but also constitutes a particular phenomenology of knowledge, wherein observation, detection, and prediction coalesce into a new modality of understanding mediated by machine logic."

## Know -  How

> ...

- Actor-Network Theory (Latour): Treats radar as part of a network (humans, algorithms, airspace laws). But it may dilute power analysis.

- Cyborg Theory (Haraway): Sees radar as blurring human/machine. But it’s less focused on material contradictions.

- Postphenomenology (Ihde): Examines how radar mediates experience. But it may underplay political economy.

A one-sided focus on radar as a technical object or phenomenotechnique risks either:

    Fetishizing its materiality (ignoring its sociopolitical dimensions), or

    Overemphasizing its knowledge-production (ignoring its biases and failures).
