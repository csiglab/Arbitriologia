# Cartilla minima para razonar sobre  el desarrollo economico: marcos y modelos

> We propose a **framework** to understand how societies **think** and **act** to transform their conditions and pursue development—both by **convergence** and **fronteir progress**. To do this, we take an abstract view of society and change, analyzing the **space of societies** and the dynamics of **economic transformation in a given society**.

## Abstract

> In this document, we propose an **abstract framework** for thinking about wealth & **development (convergence and  progress)**. The framework is organized around two deeply interconnected themes: the **Cognitive Side**—how societies think about wealth, development, and themselves—and the **Reality Side**—the material structures of wealth, production, and constraints that shape developmental possibilities. Between these lies the **intersection (operational interface)**, where cognition meets reality `thereby enabling` strategy, action, organization and feedback  in order to `transform reality` in a way that solves **economic development problems (convergence &  global frontier progress)**.

### Framework Architecture

#### 👁️ Observing Society

> This section focuses on understanding the structural, cultural, institutional, and historical dimensions of societies as a foundation for reasoning about development. Observing society involves analyzing how people organize themselves, how institutions emerge and evolve, and how values, norms, and power relations shape collective behavior. It is the first step in identifying the constraints, opportunities, and trajectories available to a given society.

## 🏗️ Reality Side

> The material structures and constraints that shape development possibilities.

### Development Problem Formulation

> **Human groups** face various **material constraints** that limit access to essentials such as food intake, shelter, transportation, communication, and other vital resources. Despite these limitations, some societies manage to overcome scarcity and generate abundance and wealth. This transformation is largely driven by the creation and adoption of new technologies.

> A key example from the medieval period is the introduction of the **heavy plow** and the **three-field crop rotation system** in Northern Europe. The heavy plow made it possible to till the dense, clay-rich soils of the north more effectively than earlier tools, while the three-field system increased land productivity by rotating crops across three plots—one with a winter crop, one with a spring crop, and one left fallow. This combination increased yields, reduced soil exhaustion, and allowed for more reliable food supplies. The resulting surplus supported population growth, urbanization, and the revival of trade and markets.

Problem Definition:

- The **economic development problem** centers on mobilizing and enhancing human potential to transform material constraints into sustained growth, increased productivity, and long-term improvements in well-being.

- The **convergence problem** *(or catching-up challenge)* involves designing and implementing strategies that enable late-developing societies to absorb, adapt, and internalize the technological and organizational foundations of modern production—eventually reaching the capacity to generate frontier innovations and create new technological paradigms.

- The **frontier progress problem** *(leapfrogging and innovation leadership)* consists in advancing beyond existing global capabilities by generating novel technologies, redefining product categories, and shaping new productive trajectories—often under uncertainty and structural inertia.

### Wealth: Human Capital, Technology, Markets and  Production Systems

> Understanding how societies generate and sustain wealth requires examining the complex interplay between goods, productive capabilities, and the structures that support economic activity. Wealth creation is not a singular process; it can emerge through various pathways—ranging from the adoption and innovation of productive technologies to the extraction and transformation of natural resources. This section explores these different modes of wealth generation, highlighting how the development of capabilities and the strategic management of resources underpin long-term economic progress and resilience.

#### Paths of Wealth

1. **Adoption of productive capabilities** — This refers to the development of technologies, institutions, skills, and infrastructure that transform how resources are used, enabling sustained increases in productivity, innovation, and economic complexity. This is the foundation of long-term, endogenous wealth creation.
2. **Creation of new productive capabilities** — This refers to the development of technologies, institutions, skills, and infrastructure that transform how resources are used, enabling sustained increases in productivity, innovation, and economic complexity. This is the foundation of long-term, endogenous wealth creation.
3. **Extraction and Exploitation of Existing Resources** — This refers to drawing on natural endowments such as fertile land, mineral reserves, forests, or advantageous trade positions—often in relation to countries that possess the technological capacity to generate material abundance. While this path can yield short-term wealth, it is constrained by resource depletion, diminishing returns, and vulnerability to external dependencies and price fluctuations.
4. **Hybrid Resource-Industrial Systems** — In this model, wealth is generated by combining resource extraction with the domestic development of technological and industrial capabilities. Rather than exporting raw materials, the focus is on building value chains that include semi-processing, refining, and eventually advanced transformation of natural resources. If well-managed, this pathway can serve as a transitional platform toward broader productive diversification.

#### On The Role of Technology

> Technology (from the Greek techne, meaning “art” or “craft”) forms the foundation of productive capabilities and drives the processes of production, generating both goods—technical objects or otherwise—and services.

> **Note**: Technology should not be confused with technical objects themselves; rather, it encompasses the knowledge, methods, and processes behind their creation and use.


### Measuring Development

> To understand and guide development effectively, it is essential to measure its multiple dimensions. Development is not a single indicator but a complex, evolving process involving economic transformation, social progress, institutional quality, technological advancement, environmental sustainability, and human agency. This section outlines a comprehensive set of metrics used to assess the structure, depth, and trajectory of development in a society. These indicators help identify strengths, bottlenecks, and strategic opportunities for long-term progress.

### Structure of the Development Process

> How does a phase transition occur in the development process? What should be the pace of changes in development? What characteristics make changes significant and how deep must they be to trigger a phase transition? How broad and deep should they be? Can the market alone **coordinate development?**

> The **development process** is a complex adaptive socio-technical system characterized by the dynamic interaction and co-evolution of heterogeneous agents, institutional arrangements, and technological subsystems within multiscalar temporal and spatial contexts. It encompasses the **continuous transformation of the system’s state vector**—representing economic, social, political, and infrastructural variables—through endogenous and exogenous inputs, governed by non-linear feedback loops and subject to path dependency and structural constraints.

Formally:

* Let the **state space** $S(t) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ represent the vector of key development indicators (e.g., GDP per capita, human capital index, institutional quality metrics, technological capability indices).

* The evolution of $S(t)$ is described by a dynamical system:

$$
\frac{dS}{dt} = F(S(t), I(t), E(t), \theta)
$$

where:

* $F$ is a non-linear vector-valued function encoding the system’s endogenous growth dynamics, incorporating production functions, innovation diffusion, institutional feedback, and social capital formation.

* $I(t)$ represents **institutional configurations and policy parameters** acting as control variables shaping incentives and transaction costs.

* $E(t)$ denotes **exogenous environmental factors** including global market conditions, geopolitical influences, and resource availability.

* $\theta$ is a vector of system parameters reflecting technological capabilities, cultural norms, and infrastructure quality.

### **Development Environment & Constraints** (Structural, Institutional, Temporal)

> Constraints are not excuses; they are the design space within which a society can act.

> Development does not unfold in a vacuum—it is shaped by a layered environment of **constraints** and **possibilities**. These constraints are not merely obstacles, but the structural contours that define the space within which a society imagines, plans, and enacts transformation. Understanding these dimensions—**structural**, **institutional**, and **temporal**—is key to designing viable pathways for progress.

## 🧠 Cognitive Side

> How societies think—about themselves, others, and development.

> What is the relationship and dynamic between society, the economy, and development? Is society and the economy a complex and adaptive phenomenon? What is the role of institutions? What is the relationship between techno-productive and social coevolution?

- Collective Self-Cognition Model
- Collective Cognition of Others
- Modelling The Dyanmics of Perception & Response of Progress Asymmetry

### Collective Self-Cognition & Otherness Model

> A unified framework to understand how Society B perceives its developmental inferiority relative to Society A, processes that perception through cultural and cognitive filters, and generates systemic responses—strategic, emotional, or ideological.

> `Observer/s ->  Perception ->  [Processing] ->  Response -> Feedback`.

> How societies think and response to other societies progress?

> Model(We) vs Model (the Other)

- **Bourdieu**: The asymmetry is habituated into the collective doxa via symbolic capital.
- **Social Comparison Theory (Festinger)**: Societies assess themselves through others, generating aspiration or resentment.
- **Mimetic Desire (Girard)**: Societies desire what others desire/have, leading to emulation or rivalry.
- **Systems Theory**: Society B's reaction depends on internal feedback loops, stability, and identity.
- **Developmental Ideology**: Societies with strong endogenous development ideologies are more likely to act.

| **Stage**                | **Type**                   | **Description**                                                                                                                                          | **Sample Questions**                                                                                          |

| **Contact Layer**     | *Perception*               | Initial sensory or symbolic exposure to Society A. May include material (technology), institutional (governance), or symbolic (language, media) signals. | How visible is A? Through what channels? What is emphasized—wealth, efficiency, values, aesthetics?           |
| **Contrast Layer**    | *Perception*               | Recognition of qualitative difference or superiority. Salient differences framed cognitively as gaps, lacks, or impossibilities.                         | In what dimensions does B feel inferior? Is the gap material, moral, spiritual, aesthetic, or all?            |
| **Causal Layer**      | *Cognitive Framing*        | Society B constructs theories of why the asymmetry exists. Includes internalist, externalist, structural, or divine/moral explanations.                  | Why is A ahead? Is it due to exploitation, better institutions, luck, or divine will?                         |
| **Affective Layer**   | *Emotional Response*       | Affective orientation to asymmetry: admiration, humiliation, envy, indifference, resentment, prideful rejection.                                         | Is the feeling one of aspiration, defeat, anger, or determination? Is it elite-only or widespread?            |
| **Ontological Layer** | *Identity Processing*      | Asymmetry is integrated into or rejected from B’s self-image. Identity either adapts to or resists the perceived status differential.                    | Does B internalize inferiority? Reframe development? See itself as destined to lag—or as uniquely valuable?   |
| **Diagnostic Layer**  | *Problem Recognition*      | Recognition of B’s underdevelopment as a systemic condition. May involve technical, moral, or political diagnosis.                                       | Is backwardness seen as a problem? If so, what’s to blame: the system, the elites, the people, the culture?   |
| **Strategic Layer**   | *Response Formation*       | Based on perception and diagnosis, B formulates strategies: mimicry, rejection, hybridization, indifference, or resistance.                              | Is there a desire to catch up or follow a different path? Are responses elite-led, bottom-up, or fragmented?  |
| **Operational Layer** | *Execution & Mobilization* | Concrete implementation: reforms, institutions, educational changes, industrial policy, or rhetorical campaigns.                                         | Can the state or society act on this vision? Is it effective or performative? Is there elite and mass buy-in? |
| **Feedback Layer**    | *Systemic Adaptation*      | Outcomes reinforce or challenge the original perception. Failure or success of response alters the next cycle of perception and strategy.                | Does action lead to pride, despair, anger? Is the asymmetry reaffirmed, reduced, or reframed?                 |

### Strategic Layer (Long-term vision & direction)

Here’s a clear and precise definition for the:

### Strategic Layer (Long-term vision & direction)

---

The **Strategic Layer** represents the highest level of planning in development policy. It sets the **long-term vision, fundamental goals, and overarching direction** for national or regional development efforts. This layer defines **where the country or region aims to be** in the medium to long run (typically 10–30 years), articulating the desired structural transformation, economic diversification, social inclusion, and sustainability objectives.

**Key features:**

* **Vision-setting:** Establishes aspirational and normative goals aligned with national values and global commitments (e.g., sustainable development, industrial modernization).
* **Priority Framework:** Identifies priority sectors, capabilities, and cross-cutting challenges to focus resources and efforts.
* **Guiding Principles:** Frames policy coherence and alignment across ministries, agencies, and stakeholders.
* **Adaptive Orientation:** Recognizes uncertainties and fosters flexibility to adjust pathways as new information and conditions arise.
* **Coordination & Leadership:** Provides a mandate for coordinated multi-sectoral planning and investment, involving public and private actors.

**Outputs at this layer typically include:**

* National development plans and visions
* Long-term sectoral strategies
* Strategic frameworks for innovation, industrialization, or green transition
* Institutional mandates for cross-cutting coordination bodies

### Programmatic Layer (Policy, planning, prioritization)

> The **Programmatic Layer** translates the long-term strategic vision into **concrete policy frameworks, detailed planning, and prioritized action areas**. This layer operates at the medium-term horizon (typically 3–7 years) and provides the **roadmap for achieving strategic goals** by specifying which sectors, programs, and initiatives will receive focus and resources.

**Key features:**

* **Policy Formulation:** Develops detailed policies aligned with the strategic vision, specifying objectives, targets, and instruments.
* **Sectoral & Thematic Planning:** Breaks down strategy into sector-specific plans (e.g., manufacturing, agriculture, digital economy) and cross-cutting themes (e.g., skills development, climate resilience).
* **Resource Prioritization:** Allocates budgets and mobilizes financing to priority programs and projects with expected high impact.
* **Coordination Mechanisms:** Defines roles, responsibilities, and governance structures to ensure coherent implementation across agencies.
* **Monitoring Frameworks:** Establishes indicators and milestones to track progress and adjust plans as needed.

**Outputs at this layer typically include:**

* National and sectoral development policies
* Medium-term development plans and investment programs
* Policy frameworks for innovation, trade, infrastructure, social inclusion
* Coordination platforms and governance guidelines

### Tactical Layer (Execution & adjustment)

The **Tactical Layer** focuses on the **day-to-day implementation, management, and adaptive adjustment** of development policies and programs. Operating at the short-term and operational horizon (typically monthly to yearly), this layer ensures that plans and strategies translate into concrete actions, while remaining flexible to respond to emerging challenges and opportunities.

**Key features:**

* **Program Implementation:** Carries out projects, initiatives, and interventions as defined by programmatic plans.
* **Resource Management:** Oversees budgeting, procurement, staffing, and logistics needed for effective delivery.
* **Monitoring & Feedback:** Collects real-time data on progress, outputs, and outcomes to inform timely adjustments.
* **Problem Solving & Adaptation:** Identifies bottlenecks, risks, and changing conditions, enabling responsive course corrections.
* **Stakeholder Engagement:** Coordinates with beneficiaries, private sector, local governments, and civil society to ensure relevance and impact.

**Outputs at this layer typically include:**

* Project execution reports and operational dashboards
* Adaptive management decisions and revised workplans
* Field-level coordination meetings and stakeholder consultations
* Capacity-building activities and troubleshooting documentation


### Reflective Layer (Monitoring, learning, adaptation)

> The **Reflective Layer** focuses on the continuous **monitoring, evaluation, learning, and adaptive management** of development policies and programs.

## Development Thinking Pitfalls

> ¿Deberíamos centrarnos en explicar la **pobreza** o la **riqueza**?  ¿Combatir una **condición negativa** o crear una **condición positiva**?

- Negative Policy: To Comact Povewrty in Poor Countrieas: Es común que las personas**, en lugar de analizar las causas de la riqueza**, se enfoquen en **explicar la pobreza**. Superficialmente observan la corrupción, el descontrol, el hambre, o la falta de civismo en la sociedad, y suelen atribuir estos problemas y la ausencia de riqueza al "gobierno" o a una mala administración. Este enfoque es retrógrado y poco constructivo; se trata de un **análisis estático** y **fatalista** limitado a la enumeracion de sintomas, no abordando la otra cara de la moneda - riqueza y las **`dinamicas`** para llegar a ella.
- **Development is synonymous with achieving immediate improvements in quality of life**: A common misconception is to treat development simply as achieving certain welfare outcomes—such as higher income, better health, or education—without recognizing that development is fundamentally the *process* by which societies build productive capacities, institutions, and innovations needed to sustain those improvements. Put differently, development is often confused with its *end goals* rather than understood as the ongoing *dynamic transformation*—through advances in technology, skills, infrastructure, and governance—that enables societies to overcome material constraints and achieve lasting well-being. This misunderstanding can result in policies aimed at short-term relief or isolated metrics, neglecting the deeper structural changes required for sustained growth and resilience.
- **Development is a linear or automatic process:** Many assume that economic growth naturally follows investment or aid, ignoring complex social, political, and institutional dynamics and path dependencies.
- **There is not such a thing as a development model:**
  - In fact, ***development models*** are widely recognized in policy and academic discourse as structured configurations of a society’s institutional arrangements, legal systems, and governance mechanisms. These frameworks establish the enabling conditions for productive investment, enterprise development, and innovation.
  - Nonetheless, such models should not be miscbonstrued as rigid or universally applicable templates. Development unfolds within dynamic and uncertain environments, and effective models must exhibit adaptive capacity. A useful analogy is that of traveling with a lightweight backpack: policymakers must carry only essential instruments and be prepared to revise, replace, or augment them in response to changing terrain—be it economic shocks, institutional bottlenecks, or technological shifts. Adaptive governance, contextual sensitivity, and iterative learning are thus central to any viable development strategy.
- **Countries** should focus on what they do best (Static Comparative Advantage): ...
- **Markets** alone can coordinate development, provided the necessary institutional and legal frameworks are in place.
- **Education** is often positively correlated with development, but correlation alone is misleading. For education to drive economic transformation, it must be aligned with the productive structure—whether through technical, scientific, or industry-linked pathways. A system focused primarily on improving scores in international assessments like the PISA test may enhance cognitive metrics without necessarily building the capabilities required for innovation, industrial upgrading, or technological might.

### Análisis y Explicación

> …

## 🌀 Contra la “razón” circular: El Desarrollo No Se Hereda, Se Construye

> Desarrollo → Desarrollo ≠ Condición inicial → Desarrollo

> Dejar de Justificar el Estancamiento.

> El desarrollo no es la prolongación automática de un punto de partida favorable, sino la superación activa de un punto de partida cualquiera —por adverso que sea.

> No es la herencia lo que determina el desarrollo, sino la capacidad de transformarla.

> El desarrollo no se frustra por las condiciones heredadas, sino por la inercia institucional, la falta de visión histórica, y la ausencia de voluntad transformadora para superar esas condiciones.

> El punto de partida no se elige. Factores como infraestructura deficiente, escasa educación, débil gobernanza, rezago tecnológico o aislamiento internacional son obstáculos reales.  Pero no explican por sí mismos el estancamiento: lo decisivo es cómo se actúa frente a ellos.

### What underpins the economic greatness and developmental ambitions of some nations (Brazil vs Japan)?

> **Elites and Incentives**: Japanese elites were historically invested in national industrial autonomy; Brazilian elites profited from rent extraction, land, and finance.

> **Institutional Design**: Japan built robust institutions (e.g., MITI) to steer policy and coordinate sectors; Brazil’s institutions are often disconnected from long-term planning.

> **Development as Identity**: Japan internalized development as existential, tied to national survival; Brazil never established a hegemonic project around productive sovereignty.

| **Dimension**              | **Japan**                                                                                          | **Brazil**                                                                                              | **Analysis**                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Developmental Ideology** | Deeply technonationalist; economic and technological self-sufficiency are non-negotiable.          | Fragmented; oscillates between nationalist rhetoric and dependency on commodity booms.                  | Japan sees power through *productive capability*, Brazil tolerates external dependence.       |
| **Post-war Strategy**      | Full-state mobilization for industrialization and technological mastery (MITI, keiretsu).          | Periodic state-led efforts (Vargas, BNDES) undermined by inconsistent political will and elite capture. | Japan engineered a production-state; Brazil has not sustained a developmental coalition.      |
| **View of Technology**     | Strategic asset and tool of sovereignty.                                                           | Treated more as imported utility than national mission.                                                 | Japan builds tech; Brazil consumes it.                                                        |
| **Role of Industry**       | Core to nationhood. Heavy investment in advanced manufacturing, robotics, electronics, automotive. | Industry devalued; decline in manufacturing share, rise in primary sector exports.                      | Brazil underwent premature deindustrialization without replacement strategy.                  |
| **Education & R\&D**       | Early and massive investment in STEM education and research institutions.                          | Underfunded, fragmented university system; weak tech-transfer pipeline.                                 | Japan linked education to national production system.                                         |
| **Cultural Factors**       | National pride tied to excellence, discipline, long-term vision.                                   | High cultural creativity, but low political commitment to productive transformation.                    | Culture doesn’t determine outcome, but mediates how ambition is translated into institutions. |
| **Global Strategy**        | Exports high-tech products, maintains manufacturing base at all costs.                             | Exports raw materials, soy, oil, and low-value-added goods.                                             | Brazil functions structurally as a 21st-century colony in trade terms.                        |
| **State Role**             | Developmental state: strategic, competent, and embedded in industry.                               | Often captured by elites; lacks bureaucratic coherence.                                                 | Institutional depth is key to autonomy and long-term development.                             |

### Why **Nations** like **Spain** with a Hard XIX Centry did mantain and improve their **techpatriotism**?

> “To be a great nation, we must produce, invent, and master technology ourselves.”

> **Technopatriotism** is the cultural, ideological, and political attitude that links a nation's identity, pride, and greatness to its achievements and capabilities in science, technology, and industrial production. It involves seeing technological progress not just as an economic or practical goal, but as a core element of national sovereignty, strength, and destiny.

Key Elements:

- National pride in technological and scientific achievements (e.g., space programs, military tech, industrial innovation).
- The belief that technological advancement is essential for national development and global status.
- Political and social mobilization around technology as a symbol of national unity and progress.
- Often accompanied by protectionist policies, government investment in R&D, and education focused on STEM fields.
- Can serve as a response to national crises or perceived decline, mobilizing tech as a means of regeneration.
- ...

| **Sovereignty Through Capability**       | Belief that real independence requires **control over productive and technological capacity**.          | China’s self-reliance doctrine; India's ISRO         |
| **Valorization of Science & Work**       | Cultural elevation of **technicians, engineers, and builders** as patriotic figures.                    | Soviet engineer cult; German industrial pride        |
| **State-led Modernization**              | The state positions tech progress as a **national mission**, not a market accident.                     | French dirigisme; Korea’s chaebol-industrial policy  |
| **Technocratic-Elite Leadership**        | Emergence of **engineers, planners, and scientists** as national decision-makers or ideologues.         | Spain’s Opus Dei technocrats; Soviet Gosplan         |
| **Historical Narratives of Greatness**   | Use of past imperial, industrial, or scientific achievements to justify **modern tech-driven revival**. | Spain’s imperial science legacy; UK’s naval power    |
| **Geopolitical Competition**             | Technology framed as a **strategic domain** in international rivalry and survival.                      | Cold War (US vs USSR); US-China chip war             |
