## German School Economics

> The **German School** emphasized the importance of empirical research in economics, including using historical data and case studies. They believed that economic theory should be grounded in empirical observation and that abstract reasoning should be avoided.
> 

> The German Historical School of Economics, rooted in the 19th-century, emphasized the importance of historical, cultural, and institutional factors in understanding economic phenomena, advocating for a context-specific and interdisciplinary approach to economic analysis.
> 

> The German School believed that the state had a role to play in shaping economic outcomes, mainly through providing public goods and regulating economic activity. They argued that the state was responsible for promoting economic development and social welfare and that laissez-faire policies were inadequate to achieve these goals.
> 

> The German School focused on economic institutions, such as legal systems, property rights, and social customs, as critical factors in shaping economic outcomes. They believed that institutions played a crucial role in determining economic behavior and outcomes and that economic analysis should focus on the interactions between institutions and economic actors.
