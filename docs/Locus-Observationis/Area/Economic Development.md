**Core Philosophy**

- **Atomic Units of Change**: Identify fundamental "events" or "levers" (e.g., policy shifts, technological breakthroughs, institutional collapses).
- **Layered Analysis**:
    - *Surface-level*: Observed economic phenomena (GDP growth, industrial shifts).
    - *Generative structure*: Underlying rules, incentives, and power dynamics that produce those phenomena.
- **Dynamic Systems View**: Economies as evolving ecosystems where adaptation, decay, and rebirth are constant.

- A *systematic anatomy* of economic life.
- A *diagnostic toolkit* for detecting, predicting, and maybe even steering economic evolution.

Still **modular** enough that you can apply it to:

- A country
- A region
- A sector
- A firm (macro-micro analysis)

Methods:

- **Temporal Dynamics (First Order Dynamics)**
    
    → How the system evolved in phases.
    
- Structural Change (Second **Order Dynamics**)
- **Benchmarking**
    
    → Compare to peer nations or historic analogs.
    
- **Causal Analysis**
    
    → What factors drove changes? (Policy? War? Tech breakthrough? Institutional reform?)
    
- **Temporal Phasing**: Map evolution into distinct eras (e.g., "Post-WW2 Bretton Woods → 1970s Stagflation → Neoliberal Globalization").
- **Counterfactual Analysis**: "What if X policy/technology/shock had not occurred?"
- **Benchmarking**: Compare against peer nations (e.g., South Korea vs. Argentina’s divergence).
- **Network Analysis**:
    - Trade/exposure networks.
    - Elite power networks (e.g., corporate board interlocks).
- Equlibrium Analysis: Structural Equilibrium

Parts:

- **Institutions**: Who decides? Who acts? Who controls?
- **Material structure**: What gets produced? How? By whom?
- **Knowledge dynamics**: How is know-how created, transferred, lost?
- **Competitive landscape**: How does competition *reshape* economies?
- **Shocks and emergence**: How do unpredictable events push systems into new forms?
- **Descriptions vs. causal mechanisms**: Not just "what happened" but "why and how it happened."

How:

- Institutional Context
    - Government Institutions
    - Policy Centers / Labs; etc.
    - Legal Framework
- Economic Praxis
- Emergent Phenomena
- Management Events (My Competitor Nation Get’s Smash in a War; My Market Share Increases)
- Taxation
- Monetary System
- Political Economy
- Government → Public Relation & Interaction
- External Commercerse
- Units of Analysis:
    - Internal Regional Economies
    - National Economies
    - External Regional Economies
    - International Economies
- Description
    - Productive Structure → Evolution
    - Productive Units
    - Knowledge Replication → Aka.  New Labor Force Formation
    - Technology Abortion → Why? Learn It by reverse engineering  or hiring foreign experts?
    - Knowledge decay
    (Industries where skills or technologies are lost over generations.)
    - **Innovation systems structure** (University–Industry–Government relations.)
    - 
    - Export Structure
    - Import Structure
    - Internal Market
    - **Management Events**
        
        → Exogenous shocks: wars, financial crises, regime changes, competitor collapses.
        
    - **Adaptive Responses**
        
        → How industries, firms, or governments reconfigure after shocks.
        
    - Industrial Cluster (Ecology); Supply Chains
    - Technology Abortion / Transfer Failure
    - Industry; It’s Economic Intrinsics
        - Technology; Scale; Process Technology; Open Problems; Competitors; Supply  Chain
        - Scale → Cost Graph
        - Cost of Operation & Ownership
        - Competitors Analysis
        - **Cost Structures**
            - Cost of operation and ownership models.
            - Scale-cost curves (fixed vs variable cost dominance).
        - **Supply Chain Mapping**
            - Key inputs, bottlenecks, integration/disintegration.
        - **Competitor Analysis**
            - Domestic and international players.
            - Market shares, strategic capabilities.
    - Regulation (Quality → Industrial Consolidation)
