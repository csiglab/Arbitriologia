3. **ISSN (International Standard Serial Number)**: Identifies serial publications such as journals, magazines, and newspapers.
4. **ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID)**: Provides unique identifiers for researchers to distinguish their work and ensure proper attribution.
5. **ISRC (International Standard Recording Code)**: Identifies sound recordings and music videos.
6. **ISNI (International Standard Name Identifier)**: Identifies individuals and organizations involved in creative works.
7. **EIDR (Entertainment Identifier Registry)**: Identifies audiovisual content such as movies, TV shows, and web videos.
