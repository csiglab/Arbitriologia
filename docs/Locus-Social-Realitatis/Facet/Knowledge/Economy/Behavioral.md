# Behavioral Economics

> Behavioral Economics is the study of how psychological, cognitive, emotional, cultural, and social factors influence the economic decisions of individuals and institutions ‚Äî and how those decisions deviate from those predicted by classical economic theory based on the assumption of fully rational agents.

| **Anchoring Effect**  | Reliance on an initial piece of information when making decisions           |
| **Loss Aversion**     | Stronger reaction to losses than to equivalent gains                        |
| **Mental Accounting** | Separating money into different accounts mentally affects spending behavior |
| **Status Quo Bias**   | Preference for the current state over change                                |
