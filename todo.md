## USA Public AI Startegy - Gov Productivity

1. At the heart of this is the “AI. gov” project, developed by the General Services Administration (GSA) in collaboration with Technology Transformation Services (TTS) under the leadership of Thomas Shedd.
2. According to the plans, Shedd, formerly a software engineering manager at Tesla, is aiming for a “startup-like” way of working - with the aim of making the federal administration AI-first and largely automating many processes.
3. The repository contained several key building blocks: an AI chatbot to take over administrative tasks; an API platform to integrate external models from OpenAI, Google Anthropic and others;
4. and an analytics dashboard called CONSOLE, which authorities can use to monitor the use of AI in real http://time.An official launch of AI. gov was apparently planned for July 4 - US Independence Day.

## Should We Regulate Information:

Mis-information: Choices

- [ ]  **Regulations; Ban**
(Strict control, possibly banning misinformation through laws or rules.)
- [ ]  **Allow; Correction; Positive Signals; Nurture a Data Market**
(Allow misinformation but focus on correcting it, signaling positive behavior, nurturing a market for data correction; and information (bloomberg terminal for all), making correction tools a basic necessity, and developing platforms for information quality.)
- [ ]  **Synthesis / Hybrid Potential**: The second model is more robust in liberal-democratic societies and supports long-term cultural resilience, but it likely needs **minimal regulation** as a foundation (e.g., against foreign propaganda, child-targeted disinformation, or AI-manipulated content). A **mixed approach**—establishing baseline legal norms while investing in correction infrastructure and public knowledge tools—may be the most sustainable.

## Models  Schools

- Capability Maturation Model (CMM): Often used to stage institutional development, going from basic to "center of excellence."
- Peer Learning Systems: Encouraging horizontal transmission from better schools to others (requires strong governance).
- Industrial Clustering Analogy: These schools function like "anchor firms" in clusters, raising standards in the local ecosystem.
