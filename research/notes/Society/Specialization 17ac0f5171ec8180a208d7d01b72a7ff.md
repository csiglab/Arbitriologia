# Specialization

: 14

> Another Scottish economist, Adam Smith, highlighted the advantages of specialization in a free-market system. Rather than having a group of workers, each producing an entire item from start to finish, Smith explained that itâ€™s usually far more productive to have each of them specialize in one aspect of production. He also cautioned that each worker might not enjoy such a life; this is a trade-off of the specialization model.
