# Locus Social Realitis

> In this note, we will introduce a framework "template" for representing the Social Sphere of Reality, alongside other alternative frameworks, with particular attention to what makes creating such template both special and challenging.

> The structure of the framework will follow the sequence: Reality → Representation Forms (Template) → Representation.

## The Social Sphere

> The emergent outcome of agents (humans), their interactions, and the environment in which they operate. It is a dynamic system in which individual and collective behaviors, structured relationships, and environmental conditions co-evolve, producing persistent patterns, institutions, and norms that both enable and constrain future actions.

> Formally, social reality can be understood as the totality of agents—each possessing non-ontic mental entities—together with the physical and structural environment in which their interactions take place.

> Agents’ mental representations may correspond either to ontic entities—objects or phenomena that exist independently in reality—or to non-ontic entities, such as concepts, ideas, or abstractions without independent existence. Mental representations of non-ontic entities, like “Progress” or “Modernity,” are crucial for understanding social reality, because these shared representations guide actions and behaviors. In this sense, they function as potential entities, shaping the dynamics of social systems despite lacking independent existence.

| **Path Dependence**           | Current social configurations are shaped by historical trajectories, making some developments more likely than others.                               | Legacy of colonial institutions, entrenched legal systems          |
| **Emergent Institutions**     | Repeated interactions solidify into formal and informal rules, norms, and structures over time.                                                      | Governments, corporations, professional guilds                     |
| **Cognitive Agents**          | Agents interpret, learn, and act based on mental representations, shaping social reality through understanding and decision-making.                  | Policy-making, social movements, strategic planning                |
| **Reflexivity**               | Agents and systems can reflect on their own behavior and structures, enabling feedback-driven change.                                                | Reforms, organizational self-assessment, adaptive governance       |
| **Change**                    | Social reality is dynamic; structures, norms, and interactions continuously evolve.                                                                  | Cultural shifts, technological revolutions, legislative change     |
| **Non-Ontic Entities**        | Concepts, ideas, or symbols that exist in cognition and discourse but do not have independent existence in reality.                                  | Justice, progress, democracy, trust                                |
| **Plasticity**                | Social structures and norms are flexible, capable of being reconfigured under internal or external pressures.                                        | Organizational restructuring, policy reforms                       |
| **Distributed Cognition**     | Knowledge and problem-solving are shared across agents, artifacts, and institutions, producing collective intelligence.                              | Open-source communities, scientific collaborations                 |
| **Contingency & Uncertainty** | Social outcomes are probabilistic rather than deterministic; events may unfold differently depending on context and chance.                          | Market fluctuations, election outcomes                             |
| **Feedback Loops**            | Reciprocal interactions between agents and structures reinforce or modify social patterns over time.                                                 | Economic cycles, social norm reinforcement                         |
| **Multi-level Structure**     | Social reality manifests at multiple levels (individual, group, institutional, societal), with cross-level interactions producing emergent patterns. | Organizational hierarchies, social networks                        |
| **Historicality**             | Social reality accumulates over time; past events, decisions, and structures shape present dynamics and constraints.                                 | Institutional legacies, cultural memory                            |
| **Boundary & Environment**    | Social reality is embedded in and shaped by broader ecological, geographic, and systemic contexts, which define its limits and interactions.         | Regional economies, global trade networks, environmental policies  |
| **Co-construction**           | Social reality is jointly constructed through interaction and shared understanding.                                                                  | Negotiation of meaning, collective identity                        |
| **Heterogeneity**             | Social systems are composed of diverse agents, norms, and structures, leading to variation in behavior and outcomes.                                 | Cultural diversity, economic inequality, organizational variety    |
| **Non-Boundary**              | Social reality is not fixed by strict boundaries; interactions often cross conceptual, institutional, or geographical limits.                        | Transnational networks, hybrid communities, cross-sector alliances |

### Ontic - vs Non Ontic Dualism

Understanding social reality requires distinguishing between what exists independently of human cognition and what exists primarily within it. Social phenomena are complex, layered, and often emerge from the interactions between individuals, groups, and institutions. To analyze them rigorously, it is useful to classify the elements of social reality into two broad categories: ontic and non-ontic.

Ontic elements are those structures, processes, and patterns that exist independently of any individual’s perception—they form the objective backbone of the social world. Non-ontic elements, by contrast, are cognitive constructs: beliefs, ideas, concepts, and interpretations that exist within minds and shape how agents perceive and engage with social reality.

This dualism provides a foundational lens for studying social systems. By distinguishing between elements that are “real” regardless of perception and those that are generated by cognition, we can better analyze the emergence, persistence, and transformation of social patterns. Additionally, some abstractions—such as systems, processes, and fields—straddle both categories, acting as higher-order ontic constructs that enable us to model and navigate the complexity of social reality.

Classification of Elements of Social Reality:

- **Ontic Elements**: These are the objective structures and concretions of social reality that exist independently of any individual’s perception.

- **Non-Ontic Elements**: These are mental constructs arising within individual or collective cognition, shaping how agents interpret and act within the social sphere.

- Note: Ontic elements also have their representations within the cognition of agents—if they are intelligible. Yet, their existence is not bound to any particular agent or collective.

- There is a  special class of ontic entities, somewhat mixed in nature: ideas such as process, system, or field are abstractions from reality, but at the same time, they are higher-order ontic constructs that enable us to more effectively parse and structure reality.


### Intermediate Ontological &  Analytical Abstraction

> **Secondary Conceptual Scaffolding**: These are mid-level frameworks and categories that organize and structure social phenomena for research and analysis. They build upon foundational concepts by grouping and relating elements like social groups, systems, and environments into coherent layers. This scaffolding supports clearer understanding, comparison, and integration across different scales and domains within the social sciences.

> A **social system** is a bounded, structured set of **recurrent interactions among social agents** (individuals or collectivities) that generate and sustain a pattern of collective behavior, shared meaning, and institutionalized roles through relational, normative, and communicative mechanisms, operating within and upon a material, symbolic, and temporal environment, and exhibiting varying degrees of autonomy, differentiation, self-reference, and adaptive capacity.

> **Culture** is a complex adaptive system comprising interconnected symbols, norms, values, beliefs, and practices that collectively constitute a shared framework of meaning within a social system. It emerges dynamically from the repeated interactions of Interaction Units, who negotiate, reproduce, and modify cultural patterns through social processes. As an emergent phenomenon, culture transcends individual actions yet shapes and constrains them by embedding shared meanings into actors’ cognition and behavior. This reflexive feedback loop enables culture’s persistence, evolution, and its role as both product and producer of social reality.

## Meta Ontological Framework

> An **ontology** is a formal and systematic representation of concepts, categories, and relationships within a particular domain of knowledge.

> aka. Second Order Ontology.

> Remember: The position of a researcher is that of an external observer. Be explicit about the observer’s position to properly localize reflexivity.

> A Meta-Ontological Framework is a structured system for defining, organizing, and relating the fundamental building blocks of social reality. It operates at a higher level of abstraction than domain ontologies, providing the rules, categories, and compositional logic through which social entities and processes are identified, classified, and constructed.

> This framework serves as a meta-structural foundation for modeling, simulating, and analyzing complex social systems — such as institutions, cities, power structures, roles, norms, and identities — in a rigorous and composable way.

> This enables rigorous modeling, comparison, and reasoning about social phenomena at multiple levels of abstraction.

### Interaction Unit

> An **Interaction Unit** is the fundamental cognitive and social actor or entity that participates in and generates relational events within a social system. It serves as the primary locus of agency and meaning-making in social interactions.

**Feature**:

| Feature                   | Description                                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Agentive Entity**       | Can be individual, group, organization, or compound social actor with intentional action.              |
| **Cognitive Capacity**    | Possesses internal reflexivity enabling self-observation, interpretation, and behavioral adaptation.   |
| **Relational Focus**      | Engages in interactions such as communication, cooperation, competition, and conflict.                 |
| **Nested & Scalable**     | Can be atomic (individual) or compound (group, institution), supporting multi-level analysis.          |
| **Boundary**              | Has definable conceptual or physical boundaries distinguishing it from others and the environment.     |
| **Behavioral Repertoire** | Holds a set of possible actions, strategies, or roles constrained by norms, capabilities, and context. |
| **State & Attributes**    | Maintains an internal state or status that evolves through interactions and influences behavior.       |
| **Reflexivity**           | Internal capacity for self-reference, learning, and modifying future behavior (intrinsic to unit).     |

**Levels:**

| Level                                 | Description                                          | Case Study|
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Dyadic / Pairwise**                 | Direct interaction between two agents                | Communication, exchange, conflict, cooperation                           |
| **Networked / Relational**            | Complex patterns among multiple agents               | Social networks, alliances, trade relations, kinship ties                |
| **Symbolic / Meaning-Making**         | Communication via shared symbols, language           | Discourse, narratives, semiotics, framing                                |
| **Rule-Governed / Institutionalized** | Interactions structured by formal and informal rules | Negotiation, governance, norms enforcement, legal procedures             |
| **Strategic / Game-Theoretic**        | Interaction as strategic decision-making             | Games, bargaining, signaling, competition                                |
| **Emergent Collective Behavior**      | Macro patterns from micro interactions               | Collective identity, social movements, market trends, cultural diffusion |

### Regulation

> Regulation refers to the system of norms, rules, and institutional constraints that guide and shape the behavior of Interaction Units within a social system.

It embodies a dual character:

- As a building block, regulation constitutes the structural and often codified protocols—formal laws, policies, or informal customs—that serve as fundamental constraints and enablers of social interaction.

- As an emergent phenomenon, regulation arises dynamically from the repeated interactions of agents, reflecting collectively constructed, maintained, and negotiated shared understandings and practices. These emergent norms evolve over time through social processes such as enforcement, adaptation, and contestation.

In this framework, regulation is thus both a foundational ontological element providing the scaffolding for social order and a fluid, epistemic construct continually (re)produced by Interaction Units as shared protocols for coordination and governance.

### Environemnt

> Note: Social phenomena are frequently recursive and multilayered. In this context, we focus on **geography and natural resources** as the most fundamental environment.
'
> A **Derivative Environment** is a secondary or higher-order context that emerges from, depends upon, or is shaped by a more fundamental environment (such as geography). It encompasses social, economic, cultural, institutional, informational, temporal, or cognitive layers that influence and frame human interactions and social phenomena.

### Phenomena (State Change) (Dynamics)

> A **phenomenon** is a **structured trajectory** of state tag transformations (e.g., power, trust, legitimacy, resource allocation), arising from interaction processes, under specific rules, feedback mechanisms, and boundary conditions.

### Property

> In ontology, a property is a feature, quality, attribute, or characteristic that entities—such as objects, processes, events, or states—can instantiate or possess.

> Most ontological elements can have properties, making them a fundamental means of differentiating, describing, or relating entities within an ontological framework.

## Ontology Framework(s)

> What are the other ontological frameworks proposed to ground the representation and modeling of the social sphere of reality? Which philosophers guide the representation of the social?

| **Ontology Framework**                         | **Description**                                                                                                                             | **Proponents**                                       | **Note**                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Critical Realism**                           | Social structures exist independently and have causal powers, though their effects may be partially observable.                             | Roy Bhaskar                                          | Distinguishes between the *empirical*, *actual*, and *real* levels of social phenomena.                   |
| **Structuration Theory**                       | Social life emerges from the duality of structure: agents create structures through action, and structures shape agent behavior.            | Anthony Giddens                                      | Emphasizes recursion and feedback between agency and structure.                                           |
| **Actor-Network Theory (ANT)**                 | Social phenomena arise from networks of human and non-human actors whose interactions produce effects.                                      | Bruno Latour, Michel Callon                          | Treats objects, technologies, and ideas as integral actors.                                               |
| **Social Ontology**                            | Social reality is constructed via collective intentionality and constitutive rules that define institutions.                                | John Searle                                          | Focuses on status functions and rule-based nature of institutions.                                        |
| **Systems Theory**                             | Society is a self-organizing system of communications with operational closure and functional differentiation.                              | Niklas Luhmann                                       | Abstracts social reality to networks of communication rather than individual actors.                      |
| **Social Process Ontology**                    | Social reality is dynamic and emergent; entities are events or processes rather than static things.                                         | Alfred North Whitehead, Basarab Nicolescu            | Useful for modeling change, flux, and complex interactions over time.                                     |
| **Social Constructivism**                      | Reality is co-constructed through language, symbols, and shared meaning-making processes.                                                   | Peter Berger, Thomas Luckmann                        | Emphasizes interpretive and negotiated aspects of social reality; less focused on ontology of structures. |
| **Practice Theory**                            | Social life is constituted through routinized practices; structures exist through repeated enactments of practices.                         | Theodore Schatzki, Andreas Reckwitz, Pierre Bourdieu | Focuses on embodied, material, and habitual dimensions of social action.                                  |
| **Assemblage Theory**                          | Social phenomena emerge from heterogeneous assemblages of human and non-human components; emphasizes relational and contingent connections. | Manuel DeLanda, Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari       | Emphasizes composition, interaction, and emergent properties rather than fixed structures.                |
| **Institutional Theory**                       | Social reality is shaped by institutions, rules, and norms that constrain and enable behavior.                                              | John Meyer, Brian Rowan, Douglass North              | Links formal and informal rules to social outcomes; widely used in sociology and organizational studies.  |
| **Network Theory**                             | Social structures are patterns of relationships among actors; node positions and connectivity shape outcomes.                               | Stanley Milgram, Harrison White, Duncan Watts        | Provides formal tools for analyzing relational structure and dynamics.                                    |
| **Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT)** | Social reality is shaped by mediated activity within cultural and historical contexts; emphasizes tools, community, and division of labor.  | Lev Vygotsky, Yrjö Engeström                         | Focuses on human activity as the unit of analysis; integrates cognition, social context, and development. |
| **Relational Sociology**                       | Social phenomena are constituted through relations rather than individual attributes; interactions form structures.                         | Pierpaolo Donati, François Dépelteau                 | Emphasizes relational ontology over entity-centered approaches.                                           |
| **Relational Materialism**                     | Material and social entities co-constitute each other; reality is composed of interdependent relational networks.                           | Annemarie Mol, Karen Barad                           | Focuses on entanglement of human and non-human actors; emphasizes process and intra-action.               |

## Indirection

> Also referred to as: Mediation, Representation Gap, Effective Abstraction, Relational Distance, Structural Layer, or Intermediate Form.

> Indirection in reality refers to the distance or mediation between the phenomena that exist in the world and our perception of them.

> Take the case of the concept “rock.” It is an abstract category that refers to certain configurations of matter with shared properties—hardness, solidity, mineral composition, stability, etc. We speak of “a rock” as if it were a discrete entity, but in reality there are no “rocks” as such—only continuous material processes: arrangements of atoms, molecular bonds, geological formations, and physical forces that, under certain scales and conditions, appear to us as a stable object.

> The term “rock” thus designates a layered abstraction over dynamic and continuous phenomena. What we perceive and name is a manifestation, not the underlying physical reality itself. This exemplifies indirection in reality—the gap between the stable objects of experience and the deeper, fluid structures that constitute them.

## Modelling

> Let us consider how the social sphere of reality can be represented, simulated, and analyzed. Social reality is complex, multi-level, and emergent, so models must balance fidelity, interpretability, and tractability.

### Objectives of Social Modelling

- Representation: Capture key structures, agents, interactions, and constraints in social systems.
- Explanation: Understand causal mechanisms underlying social phenomena.
- Prediction: Explore possible futures, probabilistic outcomes, and system responses to interventions.
- Intervention: Evaluate the impact of policies, norms, or innovations on social outcomes.

### Caution

> aka. Emergence Beyond the Obvious.

> Because social systems are directly observable to the human eye—unlike, for example, molecular systems—this immediacy of observation often leads to a false sense of intelligibility. Yet, at this level of organization, social systems are among the most complex phenomena in existence, due to the presence of adaptation, learning, strategic interaction, and the fact that nearly all meaningful patterns are emergent rather than reducible to simple components.

> Social systems may appear intelligible because they’re visible, but they are fundamentally complex and opaque due to emergent behavior and dynamic learning.
