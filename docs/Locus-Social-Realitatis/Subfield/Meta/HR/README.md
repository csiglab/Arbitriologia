| **Principle**                                                       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Separation (Role Layering)**: Representation, Strategy, Operation | **Representation Layer:** Defines political goals, priorities, and legitimacy claims. <br> **Strategy Layer:** Translates political intent into feasible programs, architectures, and coordinated action. <br> **Operation Layer:** Executes services, manages processes, and preserves technical expertise and institutional memory. |
| **Meritocratic Insulation**                                         | Protects the civil service from arbitrary political interference through merit-based recruitment, promotion, and disciplinary systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Capability Continuity & Institutional Memory**                    | Preserves accumulated expertise across cycles through stable careers, documentation, and knowledge systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Accountability as a Recursive Architecture**                      | Accountability embedded at every level: upward (to leadership), downward (to citizens), lateral (across agencies), and internal (within teams).                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Processability & Standardization**                                | Standard workflows, data schemas, and procedures enable clarity, scalability, and reduced corruption.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Professional Identity & Ethical Foundations**                     | A shared ethos of impartiality, integrity, and public service fosters trust and coherence in administration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Strategic Capacity (Intelligence, Foresight, Integration)**       | Uses foresight, monitoring, diagnostics, and cross-sector integration to anticipate trends and guide long-term planning.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **Digital Platformization & Modularity**                            | Shared digital platforms—identity, registries, payments, workflows—create interoperable, reusable, and efficient services.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Transparency, Auditability, and Public Visibility**               | Open processes, audit trails, accessible data, and documentation strengthen legitimacy and internal controls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Anti-Corruption by Process Design**                               | Reducing discretion through standardization, digital tracking, and segregation of duties minimizes corruption opportunities.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Adaptive Learning & Continuous Improvement**                      | Feedback loops, evaluation, pilot testing, and iterative refinement ensure evolving administrative capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Coordination Architecture (System-of-Systems)**                   | Horizontal (inter-agency) and vertical (national–local) coordination supported by shared platforms and governance mechanisms.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
