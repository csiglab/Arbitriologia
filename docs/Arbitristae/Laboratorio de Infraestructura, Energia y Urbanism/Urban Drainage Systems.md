# Urban Drainage Systems

> **Urban drainage systems** and technologies encompass a variety of approaches to manage and control stormwater runoff in urban areas.
> 

Here is a list of some standard urban drainage systems and technologies:

1. **Stormwater Drains:** Traditional underground pipes designed to collect and convey stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces to appropriate discharge points.
2. **Permeable Pavements:** Pavement materials that allow water to pass through, reducing surface runoff and promoting infiltration into the ground.
3. **Green Roofs:** Vegetated roof systems that absorb and slow down rainfall, reducing the volume and velocity of stormwater runoff.
4. **Rain Gardens:** Landscaped depressions designed to capture and treat stormwater, promoting infiltration and reducing runoff.
5. **Bioretention Basins:** Engineered basins that use vegetation and soil to capture and treat stormwater runoff before releasing it into the drainage system.
6. **Swales:** Vegetated channels or ditches designed to convey and treat stormwater runoff, promoting filtration and infiltration.
7. **Detention Basins:** Temporary storage areas for stormwater runoff are designed to control the flow rate and gradually release water.
8. **Retention Ponds:** Permanent water bodies designed to retain stormwater runoff, providing water storage and promoting natural treatment.
9. **Infiltration Trenches:** Underground trenches filled with absorbent material that promote stormwater infiltration into the ground.
10. **Cisterns and Rain Barrels:** Containers that capture and store rainwater for later use, reducing rooftop runoff.
11. **Artificial Wetlands:** Constructed wetlands that mimic natural wetland functions provide stormwater treatment and habitat enhancement.
12. **Smart Drainage Systems:** Sensor-based systems that monitor and control drainage infrastructure, optimizing water flow and reducing the risk of flooding.
13. **LID (Low Impact Development):** A holistic approach that integrates various sustainable design techniques to minimize the environmental impact of urban development on stormwater runoff.
14. **Sump Pump Systems:** Mechanical systems designed to pump excess water from building basements or lower-lying areas to prevent flooding.
15. **Subsurface Infiltration Systems:** Below-ground structures designed to store and infiltrate stormwater, often using chambers or perforated pipes.
16. **Channelization:** Modification of natural or artificial channels to control and direct the flow of stormwater runoff.
17. **Water Quality Units:** Filtration or treatment systems integrated into the drainage network to improve the quality of stormwater runoff.
18. **Check Dams:** Small dams or barriers placed in channels to slow down water flow, reducing erosion and promoting sediment deposition.
19. **Innovative Permeable Surfaces**: Advanced permeable materials for pavements and surfaces that allow stormwater to infiltrate and reduce runoff.
20. **Innovative Pipe Systems**: Smart pipes with sensors and control mechanisms to manage stormwater flow and optimize drainage networks.
21. â€¦

These systems and technologies are often combined to create comprehensive and sustainable urban drainage solutions, considering each metropolitan area's specific characteristics and challenges.
