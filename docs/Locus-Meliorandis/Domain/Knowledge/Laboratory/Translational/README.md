# Innovation

> **Note:** We will use the term Innovation to refer specifically to highly applied, market-oriented research and development activities, as distinct from basic or theoretical research.

> These entities operate at the Interface Layer between Applied Research and Market Deployment, managing the conversion of knowledge into economic artifacts (products, services, processes).
