# A Market

## Guiding Questions

* What is the ontic nature of a market? Is it a concrete entity, an emergent structure, or a conceptual abstraction?
* What substrates or conditions are required to sustain a market (e.g., resources, institutions, information, trust)?
* At what level of reality does a market exist (physical, social, informational, or conceptual)?
* What are the essential roles and functions of a market within an economic system?
* What does “market clearing” entail, and under which conditions is it achieved?
* Does a market have a predefined, structural form, or is its shape contingent upon historical, social, or institutional factors?
* What is the relationship between markets and agents? Is a market pre-existing and independent of agents, or does it emerge from agent interactions?
* How can markets be described in terms of states? For instance: optimal markets, market failures, or disequilibria.
* Which processes occur within markets (e.g., exchange, price formation, information aggregation, arbitrage)?
* Which phenomena emerge in markets (e.g., bubbles, crises, network effects, power asymmetries)?
* What properties can be defined or measured for markets (e.g., liquidity, efficiency, volatility, resilience, inclusiveness)?
