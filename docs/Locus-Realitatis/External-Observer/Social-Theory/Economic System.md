| Aspect                      | Explanation                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Methodology**             | Emphasizes *praxeology* (the study of human action), not empirical/statistical modeling.         |
| **Ontology**                | Sees the economy as the result of intentional actions by individuals, not impersonal mechanisms. |
| **Epistemology**            | Rejects positivist models and predictive equations; relies on *a priori* reasoning.              |
| **Human Agency**            | Central to its analysisâ€”economic behavior is embedded in subjective meanings and purposes.       |
| **Institutions & Norms**    | Institutions like money, property, and markets are seen as emergent from social interaction.     |
| **Historical & Contextual** | Often studies institutions in historically grounded, interpretive ways.                          |
| **Normativity**             | Often carries normative claims about liberty, individual responsibility, and spontaneous order.  |
