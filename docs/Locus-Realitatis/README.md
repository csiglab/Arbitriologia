# Locus Realitis

> The domain of material and structural reality—the interplay between the social system and its surrounding environment.

TODO:

- Labor (Action of an Agent)
- Authority - Power
- Kinship
- Belief System
- Environment - Territory
- Communication - Symbolic System - ...
- Stratification
- Solidarity

## Social Typology

> A **typology** that characterizes societies by their structure & organization (justice, political,  division of labor).

> In **modern times**; the territory constraint is not necessary for interaction; so the territorial constraint; can be drop out of the definition.

| **Level** | **Type of Society** | **Main Features** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Co-distructive (Disfuctional Human Groups)** | **Uncivilized** | Lawless, Uncontrolled, Disorderly, Chaotic, Unorganized, Rogue, Dysfunctional. |
| **Co-presence** | **Aggregation** | Collection of Humans in a Given Territory; A **horde** or **aggregation** is even **less organized** — basically **co-presence** without strong internal order. |
| **Small-Scale Societies** | **Band** | Small (20–100 people), kin-based, egalitarian, nomadic foragers. |
|  | **Tribe** | Hundreds to a few thousand people, organized by kinship (clans, lineages), horticulture or pastoralism, some informal leadership. |
| **Medium-Scale Societies** | **Chiefdom** | Thousands to tens of thousands, ranked kin groups, centralized leadership (chief), redistribution economy, often agricultural. |
| **Large-Scale Societies** | **State** | Complex bureaucracy, class stratification, formal laws, monopoly of force (police, army), intensive agriculture or industry. |
| **Post-Industrial Societies** | **Nation-State / Modern State** | Millions of people, capitalism or socialism, nationalism as ideological glue, mass media, large-scale economies and governance. |

## Ontology (The Observed)

> This **framework** is **applied recursively** to the lowest levels of social reality, as well as to more **derivative elements such as cultural, economic, political, and other domains**.

> Note: There should be a general ontological entry for Behavior; however, each Interaction Unit should also have its own specific Behavior entry reflecting its unique patterns of action and response.

## Epistemology (Observer)

| **Principle**                 | **Description**                                                                         | **Rationale**                                                                                            | **Application in Modeling**                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Empirical Grounding**       | Base models on observable evidence and measurable data.                                 | Ensures models reflect tangible reality, avoiding unfounded speculation.                                 | Prioritize data collection, sensor measurements, and documented phenomena. Validate hypotheses against real-world data. |
| **Falsifiability**            | Models must be testable and potentially disprovable by evidence.                        | Prevents dogmatism; allows refinement or rejection of flawed models.                                     | Design models with clear predictions. Actively seek evidence that could contradict the model.                           |
| **Parsimony (Occam’s Razor)** | Prefer the simplest model that adequately explains observations.                        | Reduces unnecessary complexity, minimizing errors and enhancing clarity.                                 | Eliminate redundant variables. Use minimal assumptions to achieve explanatory power.                                    |
| **Coherence**                 | Ensure internal consistency and alignment with established knowledge.                   | Avoids contradictions and leverages validated frameworks for reliability.                                | Cross-check model components for logical consistency. Integrate with existing scientific theories where applicable.     |
| **Contextual Awareness**      | Acknowledge the influence of context (cultural, temporal, situational) on observations. | Recognizes that reality is perceived through lenses; context shapes data interpretation.                 | Document contextual factors (e.g., observer bias, environmental conditions). Use context-specific variables in models.  |
| **Provisionality**            | Treat models as tentative approximations, not absolute truths.                          | Science evolves; models must adapt to new evidence without rigidity.                                     | Regularly update models with new data. Explicitly state limitations and uncertainties.                                  |
| **Reproducibility**           | Observations and model outcomes must be replicable by independent observers.            | Verifies reliability and reduces subjective bias.                                                        | Publish methodologies transparently. Share data and code for independent validation.                                    |
| **Holistic Perspective**      | Consider systems as interconnected wholes, not isolated parts.                          | Reality involves complex interactions; reductionism may overlook emergent properties.                    | Map relationships between variables. Analyze feedback loops and system-level behaviors.                                 |
| **Reflexivity**               | Critically examine how the observer’s assumptions and methods shape the model.          | Minimizes subjective distortion by acknowledging the observer’s role in knowledge creation.              | Document personal biases. Use diverse methodologies to triangulate results.                                             |
| **Pragmatic Utility**         | Prioritize models that enable effective prediction, intervention, or understanding.     | Knowledge should serve practical purposes; models must be actionable.                                    | Test model efficacy in real-world applications. Optimize for decision-making relevance.                                 |
| **Causal Adequacy**           | Include mechanisms that plausibly generate observed effects.                            | Models should reflect not just correlation but underlying causal structures.                             | Build in causal pathways; use causal inference techniques; distinguish cause from effect in variable relations.         |
| **Conceptual Clarity**        | Define all core terms, categories, and constructs unambiguously.                        | Ambiguity leads to misinterpretation; clarity enables precision and replicability.                       | Maintain glossaries. Use operational definitions and enforce terminology consistency across the model.                  |
| **Abstraction Discipline**    | Use abstraction to manage complexity without distorting essentials.                     | Poor abstraction hides important dynamics; good abstraction reveals system structure at the right level. | Layer abstractions hierarchically. Explicitly connect abstract and concrete model layers.                               |
| **Iterative Refinement**      | Knowledge develops through successive cycles of model adjustment and testing.           | Models improve through continuous feedback and recalibration.                                            | Embed iterative review processes. Update model structure and parameters as new data or insights arise.                  |
| **Epistemic Humility**        | Acknowledge limits of the model and of human understanding.                             | Prevents overconfidence and encourages openness to revision or alternative perspectives.                 | Communicate uncertainty ranges. Use sensitivity analyses and avoid overstated claims.                                   |
| **Pluralism**                 | Incorporate multiple perspectives, disciplines, or methodologies.                       | No single method reveals all dimensions of complex phenomena.                                            | Combine qualitative and quantitative inputs. Use interdisciplinary approaches and stakeholder feedback.                 |
