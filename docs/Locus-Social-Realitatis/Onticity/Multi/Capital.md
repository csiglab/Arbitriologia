# Capital

> ...

Guiding Questions:

- What is the ontic nature of Capital?
- What is the history of the term Capital?
- Under what conditions does an asset become capital?
- What distinguishes Capital from mere assets, wealth, or productive resources?
- Is Capital better modeled as a stock, a flow, or a recursive process (self-expanding value)?
- Which are teh relation with wealth and money?
- Which forms can capital take?
- Is labor a form of capital?
- Which are the possibles taxonomy, that is taxonomy space to classify capital? Which are the dimesions set to specify such taxonomy?
- If “capital” is an epistemological construct rather than a natural kind, what standards should govern its definition? What alternative conceptions of capital exist, and how should they be evaluated?

Notes:

- Capital is an abstract concept - almost an epitemological element that can denote elements of multiple form - united by a their functional role.

| **Fixed Capital**       | Capital whose **use-value is deployed repeatedly across multiple production cycles** while its **value is transferred gradually** to output via depreciation, amortization, or wear. It remains functionally intact after each cycle, though progressively degraded. |
| **Circulating Capital** | Capital whose **use-value is fully consumed within a single production cycle**, with its **entire value transferred immediately** to the output or realized through sale. It must be replenished for each new cycle.                                                 |
