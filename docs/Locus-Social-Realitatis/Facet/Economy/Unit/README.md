# Interaction Unit

> Economic Interaction Units (also referred to as agents, actors, or decision-making units (DMUs)) are entities that participate in economic interactions by making decisions related to resource allocation, production, exchange, or consumption.

## Economic Actor Space

> What is the most general characterization of the "economic actor space"? The economic actor space is the set of all entities—individual or collective, natural or artificial—that possess the capacity to make decisions, act upon resources, and participate in economic interactions within a given economic system.

## Theory: Agent Model

- **Rational Choice Theory** - This model assumes that individuals make decisions based on their self-interest and available information. The critical paper for this model is “An Axiomatic Characterization of the Quadratic Scoring Rule” by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman (1981).
- **Game Theory** - Game theory studies decision-making involving two or more individuals in strategic situations. The critical paper for this model is “Theory of Games and Economic Behavior” by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern (1944).
- **Behavioral Economics** - This model assumes that individuals are not always rational and can be influenced by psychological factors. The critical paper for this model is “Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk” by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (1979).
- **Agent-Based Modeling** - This model focuses on the behavior of individual agents and how they interact with one another. The critical paper for this model is “Garden of Forking Paths: Why multiple comparisons can be a problem, even when there is no ‘fishing expedition’ or ‘p-hacking,’ and the research hypothesis was posited ahead of time” by Andrew Gelman and Eric Loken (2013).
- **New Classical Economics** - This model assumes individuals have rational expectations and make decisions based on available information. The critical paper for this model is “Rational Expectations and the Theory of Economic Policy” by Robert Lucas Jr. (1976).

## Behavior

# Behavior

> Behavior is the observable expression of an entity’s internal dispositions as it interacts with its environment over time. It reflects the structured sequence of actions or responses performed by an interaction unit in relation to stimuli, goals, norms, and constraints.

## Signature

> Note: While behavior can be modeled as an external process, in this framework we treat behavior as the internal dispositional structure of an agent that governs how it responds to stimuli and makes decisions.

| **Aspect**              | **Description**                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**                | Dispositional Process                                                                                 |
| **Bearer**              | Interaction Unit (e.g., individual, group, organization)                                              |
| **Temporality**         | Temporally extended; behavior unfolds across time as a patterned process                              |
| **Context-Sensitivity** | Behavior adapts to external stimuli, internal states, and regulatory conditions                       |
| **Relation to Norms**   | Can conform to, deviate from, or challenge shared regulations and cultural scripts                    |
| **Observation Level**   | Can be analyzed at micro (individual), meso (group), or macro (system) levels                         |
| **Ontological Role**    | Connects internal state (e.g., preferences, beliefs) with external phenomena (e.g., outcomes, events) |
