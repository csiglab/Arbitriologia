# System of National Accounts (SNA)

> The **System of National Accounts (SNA)** is the international standard framework for compiling comprehensive, consistent, and comparable economic statistics, including national income, production, consumption, and external transactions.

## Balance of Payments (BoP)

> The **Balance of Payments (BoP)** is a comprehensive record of all economic transactions between the residents of a country and the rest of the world during a specific period, usually a year or a quarter. These transactions include trade in goods and services, cross-border investments, financial transfers, and changes in reserves.

The BoP is divided mainly into three accounts:

1. **Current Account:** Records the trade of goods and services, income from investments, and current transfers (like remittances).
2. **Capital Account:** Records capital transfers and the acquisition or disposal of non-produced, non-financial assets.
3. **Financial Account:** Records transactions that involve financial assets and liabilities, such as foreign direct investment, portfolio investment, and changes in reserve assets.

## QA

### Why is it difficult to compare economic data across countries without knowing their specific statistical frameworks?

> Because countries differ in how they classify, value, and collect economic data—such as variations in service categories, valuation methods, data sources, and reporting frequency—which leads to inconsistencies that make direct comparison unreliable without understanding each country's methodology.
