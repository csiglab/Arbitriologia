## Policy-Making Frameworks

> Various models and frameworks exist to guide policymakers in this process.
> 

Here's a list of some notable models of policy design:

Here's a table summarizing notable models of policy design:

| Model | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Rational Comprehensive Model** | Assumes policymakers have complete information and clear goals, assessing all possible alternatives systematically. |
| **Incrementalism** | Suggests policy change is gradual and occurs through minor, incremental adjustments based on feedback and experience. |
| **Garbage Can Model** | Views the policy process as chaotic, where problems, solutions, and decision-makers randomly collide; decisions are opportunistic. |
| **Advocacy Coalition Framework** | Emphasizes the role of advocacy coalitions in shaping policy through interactions and conflicts among coalitions. |
| **Punctuated Equilibrium Theory** | Proposes policy stability is interrupted by short periods of significant change, often due to external shocks or crises. |
| **Policy Streams Framework** | Developed by John Kingdon; views policy process as the convergence of problems, policies, and politics. Policy change occurs when these streams align. |
| **Multiple Streams Framework** | Extends the Policy Streams Framework with the concept of policy entrepreneurs who use opportunities to advance their solutions. |
| **Institutional Rational Choice** | Integrates rational choice theory with institutionalism, exploring how institutions shape choices and influence outcomes. |
| **Cybernetic Systems Model** | Views policymaking as a feedback system, adjusting policies based on feedback to maintain system equilibrium. |
| **Interactive Model** | Emphasizes the iterative nature of policymaking with continuous feedback loops and policy revisions. |
| **Network Governance Model** | It focuses on collaboration among various actors, including government, NGOs, and the private sector, to design and implement policies. |
| **Policy Design as Problem-Solving** | Frames policy design as a process of identifying and solving specific problems with appropriate policy instruments. |
| **Theory of Change** | Outlines causal pathways through which interventions lead to desired outcomes, used in program evaluation and policy implementation. |
| **Behavioral Economics Approach** | Draws on behavioral economics to design policies considering how individuals make decisions, incorporating nudges and behavioral interventions. |
| **Public Value Framework** | Focuses on creating public value by enhancing citizens' well-being and addressing societal needs and challenges. |

## Administrative Models

> The term "government administrative model" generally refers to a framework or approach that outlines the structure, functions, and processes of government administration.
> 

Here's a table summarizing different executive models used in government:

| Model | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Weberian Model** | Emphasizes a bureaucratic structure with hierarchical organization, clear authority lines, specialization, merit-based recruitment, and impersonal rules for efficiency and rationality. |
| **New Public Management (NPM)** | Introduced in the 1980s, focuses on market-oriented approaches, performance measurement, decentralization, contracting out services, and customer orientation for efficiency and cost-effectiveness. |
| **Participatory Governance Model** | Encourages citizen involvement in decision-making, emphasizing transparency, accountability, and collaboration between government agencies and the public to enhance democracy and responsiveness. |
| **Network Governance Model** | Highlights collaboration and partnerships among government agencies, NGOs, businesses, and other stakeholders to address complex, cross-cutting issues. |
| **Policy Network Model** | Focuses on the interaction among various actors involved in policy development, considering the influence of interest groups, experts, and bureaucrats. |
| **Neo-Institutional Model** | Examines how formal and informal rules and norms, including organizational culture and legitimacy, influence administrative behavior. |
| **Digital Governance Model** | Utilizes information and communication technologies to improve government services, enhance transparency, and engage citizens through e-government initiatives and digital platforms. |
| **Policy Implementation Model** | Focuses on the practical aspects of translating policies into action, including resource allocation, coordination, and monitoring. |
| **Policy Coordination Model** | Emphasizes mechanisms for collaboration, coherence, and alignment among multiple government agencies and levels involved in policymaking and implementation. |
| **Adhocracy Model** | Features a flexible and adaptive organizational structure with decentralization, lateral communication, and minimal formal hierarchy, suited for dynamic and innovative environments. |
