# Social Expectation

> A shared belief or anticipatory model about how others will (or should) behave in specific contexts.

## Ontology

> What is the ontological nature of the element 'Social Expectation'?

> A **cognitive state** held by one or more agents regarding the likely or appropriate behavior of another agent under a specific condition or context.

> A social expectation is an intersubjectively sustained anticipatory-normative relation that defines the feasible and appropriate behavioral space of agents within a social context.

| Aspect                        | Description                                                                                                                                           |

| **Substantiality (Onticity)** | Social expectations are non-material and semi-ontic: they exist as relational, emergent phenomena dependent on recognition by social agents.          |
| **Instantiability**           | They are abstract constructs but can be instantiated in concrete behaviors, interactions, and institutional practices.                                |
| **Temporal Persistence**      | Their existence persists as long as the social network recognizes them; they are dynamic and can evolve with norms or collective beliefs.             |
| **Cognitive Accessibility**   | Individuals can perceive, reason about, or communicate them, but only through shared recognition, observation, or social signaling.                   |
| **Conventional Dependency**   | They depend on social conventions, norms, and mutual recognition among agents for their existence.                                                    |
| **Dependence**                | They require social agents, interactions, and networks to exist; without these, the expectation cannot exist.                                         |
| **Causality**                 | Social expectations influence behaviors, decisions, and social outcomes, and can themselves be modified by changes in behavior or communication.      |
| **Order of Existence**        | They exist at the intersubjective, relational level above individual cognition but below formal institutional structures; emergent from interactions. |

## Formalism

> **Note:** The purpose of this formulation is not to fully capture the dynamics of expectation formation, but to provide a **minimal template** for modeling how expectations delimit feasible behavior.

> Social expectations delineate the **feasible behavioral space** of an agent under certain perceived conditions.

Let:

* $\mathcal{C}$ = contextual condition set (roles, norms, situational cues)
* $\mathcal{B}(a)$ = total behavioral repertoire of agent *a*
* $e$ = specific expectation
* $m$ = model of mutual recognition sustaining *e*

Then the **expected behavior set** of agent *a* under expectation *e* can be expressed as: $O(a, \mathcal{C}, e, m) = { b \in \mathcal{B}(a) \mid b \text{ satisfies } e \text{ under } \mathcal{C} \text{ and } m }$

where:

* $O(\cdot)$ denotes the **operative or observable subset** of behaviors consistent with the expectation;
* “satisfies $e$” means the behavior conforms to the normative and anticipatory conditions encoded in $e$;
* $m$ defines the degree and structure of **mutual recognition** (e.g. first-order vs. recursive expectations).

## Limits

* **Opacity of cognition:** Agents never have full access to others’ mental models; expectations are inferred, not observed.
* **Instability under perturbation:** Small norm violations or contextual shifts can collapse shared expectations.
* **Context-dependence:** Expectations are bounded to particular interactional or institutional domains.
* **Cognitive asymmetry:** Expectations may be unilateral, misaligned, or strategically distorted.
* **Temporal decay:** Without reinforcement through repeated interaction or institutionalization, expectations dissipate.
