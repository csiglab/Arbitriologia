> In this note, we introduce a template for representing **social reality**—a comprehensive social ontology—with emphasis on dynamics.

> ⚠️ Note: To explore complex terrain, a map is often necessary, but it is always incomplete and can be flawed. **Exploration beyond the map is recommended** — to build a better map and to rediscover the terrain itself. The map should orient, not dictate.

Doing:

* notion that denotes the **minimum number of agents participating in an environment** required to **give rise to, or make noticeable, a particular element of a social field**.
* Critical Mass: Critical Mass – widely used in sociology, network theory, and innovation diffusion to denote the threshold number of participants needed for a phenomenon to become self-sustaining or visible.
* Threshold – used in social network theory and collective behavior; the minimal number of adopters or participants required for a behavior, norm, or innovation to spread.
* Participation Threshold – more explicit, often used in modeling collective action.
* Minimal Cohort – emphasizes the minimal group necessary to produce the emergent social effect.
* Activation Number – used in some complex systems literature to denote the number of agents needed to trigger a system-level effect.

## Social Reality

> **Social reality** is a piece of reality composed of the patterns, structures, and norms that emerge from the interactions of agents (humans) within specific social, cultural, and institutional contexts.

### Structure

> Which set of concepts allows us to describe the structure of social reality?

| **Concept**                      | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **Role**                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Region**                       | A spatially bounded zone within social reality characterized by relatively dense and recurrent patterns of human interaction, without presupposing cultural unity, institutional coherence, or political sovereignty.                                                                             | Provides spatial anchoring for social analysis; defines where interaction occurs without reifying “societies” or “nations.” |
| **Facet**                        | An analytically distinct dimension of a social configuration (economic, political, legal, symbolic, cognitive, technical, etc.), defined by dominant causal mechanisms rather than by location or actors.                                                                                         | Enables multi-dimensional analysis of the same region or configuration; prevents mono-causal explanations.                  |

### Characterization

> Which properties characterize the **social sphere** of reality?

| **Aspect**                          | **Description**                                                                                                                                        | **Instances(s)**                                                     |

| **Resilience**                      | Capacity to absorb shocks, reorganize, and continue functioning under stress.                                                                          | Disaster recovery, post-crisis societal stabilization              |
| **Path Dependence & Historicality** | Present social configurations are shaped by historical trajectories, making certain outcomes more probable.                                            | Colonial legacies, entrenched legal or institutional systems       |
| **Emergent Institutions**           | Repeated interactions solidify into formal and informal rules, norms, and structures over time.                                                        | Governments, corporations, professional associations               |
| **Cognitive Agents**                | Agents interpret, learn, and act based on mental representations, shaping social reality through understanding and decision-making.                    | Policy-making, social movements, strategic planning                |
| **Reflexivity**                     | Agents and systems can reflect on their own behavior and structures, enabling feedback-driven change.                                                  | Organizational self-assessment, institutional reforms              |
| **Change & Dynamism**               | Social reality is inherently dynamic; structures, norms, and interactions continuously evolve.                                                         | Cultural shifts, technological revolutions, legal reforms          |
| **Synontic Entities**              | Concepts, ideas, or symbols exist in cognition and discourse but lack independent physical existence.                                                  | Justice, democracy, trust                                          |
| **Plasticity**                      | Social structures and norms are flexible and can be reconfigured under internal or external pressures.                                                 | Policy reform, organizational restructuring                        |
| **Distributed Cognition**           | Knowledge and problem-solving are shared across agents, artifacts, and institutions, creating collective intelligence.                                 | Open-source projects, scientific collaborations                    |
| **Contingency & Uncertainty**       | Social outcomes are probabilistic rather than deterministic; context, chance, and interdependencies influence events.                                  | Market fluctuations, election outcomes                             |
| **Feedback Loops**                  | Reciprocal interactions between agents and structures reinforce or modify social patterns over time.                                                   | Economic cycles, norm reinforcement                                |

| **Co-construction**                 | Social reality is jointly produced through interaction, shared understanding, and negotiation.                                                         | Collective identity formation, meaning-making processes            |
| **Heterogeneity**                   | Social systems comprise diverse agents, norms, and structures, resulting in variation in behavior and outcomes.                                        | Cultural diversity, economic inequality, organizational variety    |
| **Non-Boundedness**                 | Social reality often transcends strict conceptual, institutional, or geographical boundaries.                                                          | Transnational networks, hybrid communities, cross-sector alliances |

### Ontic - vs Synontic Dualism

> Understanding social reality requires distinguishing between what exists independently of human cognition and what exists primarily within it. Social phenomena are complex, layered, and often emerge from the interactions between individuals, groups, and institutions. To analyze them rigorously, it is useful to classify the elements of social reality into two broad categories: ontic and synontic.

> Ontic elements are those structures, processes, and patterns that exist independently of any individual’s perception—they form the objective backbone of the social world. synontic elements, by contrast, are cognitive constructs: beliefs, ideas, concepts, and interpretations that exist within minds and shape how agents perceive and engage with social reality.

> This dualism provides a foundational lens for studying social systems. By distinguishing between elements that are “real” regardless of perception and those that are generated by cognition, we can better analyze the emergence, persistence, and transformation of social patterns. Additionally, some abstractions—such as systems, processes, and fields—straddle both categories, acting as higher-order ontic constructs that enable us to model and navigate the complexity of social reality.

Classification of Elements of Social Reality:

* **Ontic Elements**: These are the objective structures and concretions of social reality that exist independently of any individual’s perception.

* **Synontic Elements**: These are mental constructs arising within individual or collective cognition, shaping how agents interpret and act within the social sphere.

* **Mixed Elements**: Entities that have both material/ontic and cognitive/synontic components. For example, a house physically exists (ontic), but its value, meaning, or social function depends on shared perceptions (synontic).


## Formalism: Social Reality

> We introduce a guiding formal framework for modeling social reality — an abstract formulation with no immediate practical use, intended instead to orient the development of concrete models and representations.

> This is **not** a model of society; it is a model of how *models of society* can be constructed.

We define a **meta-formal structure**:

$\mathcal{S} = \langle \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{E}, \mathcal{I} \rangle$

Where each component denotes a fundamental domain or relation within the modeling process:

- **Reality $(\mathcal{R})$** – The underlying domain of real processes and entities, both material and social.
- **Cognitive Agentic Domain $(\mathcal{A})$** – The set of agents capable of perception, interpretation, and action within $(\mathcal{R})$.
- **Environmental $(\mathcal{E})$** – The contextual and institutional conditions in which agents exist and interact - **including**  others agents itself.
- **Interactional Dynamics $(\mathcal{I})$** – The mappings and transformations that describe interactions between agents and environments.

### Environment Formalism

We define the environment at time $(t)$ as a structured composite of agent states and ontic elements:

$\mathcal{E}(t) = \langle A_1(t), A_2(t), \dots, A_n(t); , \mathcal{O}(t) \rangle$

Where:

- $(A_i(t))$ represents the state of agent $(i)$ at time $(t)$, including its actions and interpretations.
- $(\mathcal{O}(t))$ denotes the set of **ontic elements** — objective or shared entities that exist within $\mathcal{E}(t)$.
- The ontic set $(\mathcal{O}(t))$ may include both physical and symbolic components, such as resources, norms, and institutional structures.
- Agents perceive and interpret these ontic Eelements differently, meaning that each agent’s effective environment is a projection:  $E_i(t) = f_i\big(\mathcal{E}(t), \text{Interpretation}_i(t)\big)$
- Thus, while $\mathcal{E}(t)$ represents the **objective configuration** of the environment, each $E_i(t)$ corresponds to the **subjectively interpreted environment** as experienced by agent $(i)$.
- **Emergence:**    Group-level phenomena arise from interactions among agents and with the environment: $\text{Social Field}(t) = F\big({A_i(t)}_{i=1}^N, E(t)\big)$ Where (N) may need to exceed a **critical mass** for certain structures or patterns to stabilize.
- **Synontic Reification:** synontic elements, such as norms, reputations, or shared beliefs, exist primarily in collective cognition.   These elements are **reified** when they are treated as real objects in the social field—e.g., a law is a physical document (ontic) but its authority and enforcement depend on collective recognition (synontic).    Formally, a synontic element (X) becomes operative in the social field when:  $X(t) \in \text{Reified} \iff \exists , A_i \text{ such that } A_i \text{ recognizes or acts upon } X(t)$

### Agent Formulation

We represent a social agent (A) at time (t) as a tuple:

$A(t) = \langle O, E(t), I(t), \Pi(t), \Phi(t) \rangle$

Where:

1. **Ontic Resource Set ((O))**
   Objective properties of the agent that exist independently of perception.
   Examples: physical capabilities, resources, social position, legal status.

2. **Environment ((E(t)))**
   The dynamic social, physical, and institutional context in which the agent operates.
   Includes other agents, social norms, networks, and material conditions.
   Interaction dependency: (E(t)) depends on the actions and states of other agents.

3. **Internal State ((I(t)))**
   The agent’s internal representations, knowledge, beliefs, goals, and decision-making rules.
   Guides probabilistic behavior.

4. **Perception $\Pi(t)$**
   The agent’s observations or signals obtained from the environment:
   $   \Pi(t) \sim P(\Pi(t) ,|, E(t), O)$
   Captures what the agent actually senses or notices, which may be incomplete or noisy.

5. **Interpretation $\Phi(t)$**
   The agent’s internal processing of perceived information to update beliefs, expectations, or mental models: $\Phi(t) \sim P(\Phi(t) ,|, \Pi(t), I(t))$
   Produces a probabilistic “understanding” of the environment that guides decision-making.

6. Behavior Behavior:  Finally, the agent’s actions (a(t)) are drawn from a conditional probability distribution that depends on **ontic resources**, **interpreted perception**, and **internal state**:  $a(t) \sim P\big(a(t) ,|, O, \Phi(t), I(t)\big)$

This framework explicitly models the **information flow**: $E(t), O ;\rightarrow; \Pi(t) ;\rightarrow; \Phi(t) ;\rightarrow; I(t) ;\rightarrow; a(t)$

It supports stochastic modeling of perception errors, interpretation biases, and internal decision rules, making it fully compatible with **agent-based or Bayesian social simulations**.


## Meta Ontological Framework

> An **ontology** is a formal and systematic representation of concepts, categories, and relationships within a particular domain of knowledge.

> aka. Second Order Ontology.

> Remember: The position of a researcher is that of an external observer. Be explicit about the observer’s position to properly localize reflexivity.

> A Meta-Ontological Framework is a structured system for defining, organizing, and relating the fundamental building blocks of social reality. It operates at a higher level of abstraction than domain ontologies, providing the rules, categories, and compositional logic through which social entities and processes are identified, classified, and constructed.

> This framework serves as a meta-structural foundation for modeling, simulating, and analyzing complex social systems — such as institutions, cities, power structures, roles, norms, and identities — in a rigorous and composable way.

> This enables rigorous modeling, comparison, and reasoning about social phenomena at multiple levels of abstraction.

## Ontology (The Observed)

> This **framework** is **applied recursively** to the lowest levels of social reality, as well as to more **derivative elements such as cultural, economic, political, and other domains**.

> Note: There should be a general ontological entry for Behavior; however, each Interaction Unit should also have its own specific Behavior entry reflecting its unique patterns of action and response.

### Interaction Unit

> An **Interaction Unit** is the fundamental cognitive and social actor or entity that participates in and generates relational events within a social system. It serves as the primary locus of agency and meaning-making in social interactions.

**Feature**:

| Feature                   | Description                                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Agentive Entity**       | Can be individual, group, organization, or compound social actor with intentional action.              |
| **Cognitive Capacity**    | Possesses internal reflexivity enabling self-observation, interpretation, and behavioral adaptation.   |
| **Relational Focus**      | Engages in interactions such as communication, cooperation, competition, and conflict.                 |
| **Nested & Scalable**     | Can be atomic (individual) or compound (group, institution), supporting multi-level analysis.          |
| **Boundary**              | Has definable conceptual or physical boundaries distinguishing it from others and the environment.     |
| **Behavioral Repertoire** | Holds a set of possible actions, strategies, or roles constrained by norms, capabilities, and context. |
| **State & Attributes**    | Maintains an internal state or status that evolves through interactions and influences behavior.       |
| **Reflexivity**           | Internal capacity for self-reference, learning, and modifying future behavior (intrinsic to unit).     |

**Levels:**

| Level                                 | Description                                          | Case Study|
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Dyadic / Pairwise**                 | Direct interaction between two agents                | Communication, exchange, conflict, cooperation                           |
| **Networked / Relational**            | Complex patterns among multiple agents               | Social networks, alliances, trade relations, kinship ties                |
| **Symbolic / Meaning-Making**         | Communication via shared symbols, language           | Discourse, narratives, semiotics, framing                                |
| **Rule-Governed / Institutionalized** | Interactions structured by formal and informal rules | Negotiation, governance, norms enforcement, legal procedures             |
| **Strategic / Game-Theoretic**        | Interaction as strategic decision-making             | Games, bargaining, signaling, competition                                |
| **Emergent Collective Behavior**      | Macro patterns from micro interactions               | Collective identity, social movements, market trends, cultural diffusion |

### Regulation

> Regulation refers to the system of norms, rules, and institutional constraints that guide and shape the behavior of Interaction Units within a social system.

It embodies a dual character:

- As a building block, regulation constitutes the structural and often codified protocols—formal laws, policies, or informal customs—that serve as fundamental constraints and enablers of social interaction.

- As an emergent phenomenon, regulation arises dynamically from the repeated interactions of agents, reflecting collectively constructed, maintained, and negotiated shared understandings and practices. These emergent norms evolve over time through social processes such as enforcement, adaptation, and contestation.

In this framework, regulation is thus both a foundational ontological element providing the scaffolding for social order and a fluid, epistemic construct continually (re)produced by Interaction Units as shared protocols for coordination and governance.

### Environment

> Note: Social phenomena are frequently recursive and multilayered. In this context, we focus on **geography and natural resources** as the most fundamental environment.
'
> A **Derivative Environment** is a secondary or higher-order context that emerges from, depends upon, or is shaped by a more fundamental environment (such as geography). It encompasses social, economic, cultural, institutional, informational, temporal, or cognitive layers that influence and frame human interactions and social phenomena.

### Change

> See more in [Ontology of Change](../Locus-Meliorandis/Toolkit/Change/README.md).

### Phenomena

> A **phenomenon** is a **structured trajectory** of state tag transformations (e.g., power, trust, legitimacy, resource allocation), arising from interaction processes, under specific rules, feedback mechanisms, and boundary conditions.

### Property

> In ontology, a property is a feature, quality, attribute, or characteristic that entities—such as objects, processes, events, or states—can instantiate or possess.

> Most ontological elements can have properties, making them a fundamental means of differentiating, describing, or relating entities within an ontological framework.


## Ontology Framework(s)

| **Ontology Framework**                         | **Description**                                                                                                                             | **Proponents**                                       | **Note**                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Critical Realism**                           | Social structures exist independently and have causal powers, though their effects may be partially observable.                             | Roy Bhaskar                                          | Distinguishes between the *empirical*, *actual*, and *real* levels of social phenomena.                   |
| **Structuration Theory**                       | Social life emerges from the duality of structure: agents create structures through action, and structures shape agent behavior.            | Anthony Giddens                                      | Emphasizes recursion and feedback between agency and structure.                                           |
| **Actor-Network Theory (ANT)**                 | Social phenomena arise from networks of human and non-human actors whose interactions produce effects.                                      | Bruno Latour, Michel Callon                          | Treats objects, technologies, and ideas as integral actors.                                               |
| **Social Ontology**                            | Social reality is constructed via collective intentionality and constitutive rules that define institutions.                                | John Searle                                          | Focuses on status functions and rule-based nature of institutions.                                        |
| **Systems Theory**                             | Society is a self-organizing system of communications with operational closure and functional differentiation.                              | Niklas Luhmann                                       | Abstracts social reality to networks of communication rather than individual actors.                      |
| **Social Process Ontology**                    | Social reality is dynamic and emergent; entities are events or processes rather than static things.                                         | Alfred North Whitehead, Basarab Nicolescu            | Useful for modeling change, flux, and complex interactions over time.                                     |
| **Social Constructivism**                      | Reality is co-constructed through language, symbols, and shared meaning-making processes.                                                   | Peter Berger, Thomas Luckmann                        | Emphasizes interpretive and negotiated aspects of social reality; less focused on ontology of structures. |
| **Practice Theory**                            | Social life is constituted through routinized practices; structures exist through repeated enactments of practices.                         | Theodore Schatzki, Andreas Reckwitz, Pierre Bourdieu | Focuses on embodied, material, and habitual dimensions of social action.                                  |
| **Assemblage Theory**                          | Social phenomena emerge from heterogeneous assemblages of human and non-human components; emphasizes relational and contingent connections. | Manuel DeLanda, Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari       | Emphasizes composition, interaction, and emergent properties rather than fixed structures.                |
| **Institutional Theory**                       | Social reality is shaped by institutions, rules, and norms that constrain and enable behavior.                                              | John Meyer, Brian Rowan, Douglass North              | Links formal and informal rules to social outcomes; widely used in sociology and organizational studies.  |
| **Network Theory**                             | Social structures are patterns of relationships among actors; node positions and connectivity shape outcomes.                               | Stanley Milgram, Harrison White, Duncan Watts        | Provides formal tools for analyzing relational structure and dynamics.                                    |
| **Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT)** | Social reality is shaped by mediated activity within cultural and historical contexts; emphasizes tools, community, and division of labor.  | Lev Vygotsky, Yrjö Engeström                         | Focuses on human activity as the unit of analysis; integrates cognition, social context, and development. |
| **Relational Sociology**                       | Social phenomena are constituted through relations rather than individual attributes; interactions form structures.                         | Pierpaolo Donati, François Dépelteau                 | Emphasizes relational ontology over entity-centered approaches.                                           |
| **Relational Materialism**                     | Material and social entities co-constitute each other; reality is composed of interdependent relational networks.                           | Annemarie Mol, Karen Barad                           | Focuses on entanglement of human and non-human actors; emphasizes process and intra-action.               |

## Indirection

> Also referred to as: Mediation, Representation Gap, Effective Abstraction, Relational Distance, Structural Layer, or Intermediate Form.

> Indirection in reality refers to the distance or mediation between the phenomena that exist in the world and our perception of them.

> Take the case of the concept “rock.” It is an abstract category that refers to certain configurations of matter with shared properties—hardness, solidity, mineral composition, stability, etc. We speak of “a rock” as if it were a discrete entity, but in reality there are no “rocks” as such—only continuous material processes: arrangements of atoms, molecular bonds, geological formations, and physical forces that, under certain scales and conditions, appear to us as a stable object.

> The term “rock” thus designates a layered abstraction over dynamic and continuous phenomena. What we perceive and name is a manifestation, not the underlying physical reality itself. This exemplifies indirection in reality—the gap between the stable objects of experience and the deeper, fluid structures that constitute them.

## Modelling

> Let us consider how the social sphere of reality can be represented, simulated, and analyzed. Social reality is complex, multi-level, and emergent, so models must balance fidelity, interpretability, and tractability.

### Objectives of Social Modelling

- Representation: Capture key structures, agents, interactions, and constraints in social systems.
- Explanation: Understand causal mechanisms underlying social phenomena.
- Prediction: Explore possible futures, probabilistic outcomes, and system responses to interventions.

| **Principle**                                | **Description**                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Constructivism**                           | Knowledge is constructed by observers, not passively received from reality.                           |
| **Contextuality**                            | Truth and meaning are context-dependent, especially in social domains.                                |
| **Reflexivity**                              | Observers and agents are embedded in, and influenced by, the systems they model.                      |
| **Inter-subjectivity**                       | Knowledge arises from shared meanings and social interaction.                                         |
| **Fallibilism**                              | All knowledge is provisional and subject to revision.                                                 |
| **Pluralism**                                | Multiple perspectives may coexist and be valid.                                                       |
| **Agency and Intentionality**                | Social actors have goals, beliefs, and autonomy.                                                      |
| **Emergence**                                | Social phenomena arise from interactions among lower-level agents.                                    |
| **Non-linearity**                            | Cause and effect are not proportional.                                                                |
| **Ethical Situatedness / Value-Sensitivity** | Modeling choices embed values and have normative and ethical impacts.                                 |
| **Operationalization**                       | Concepts must be translated into measurable and observable elements.                                  |
| **Theory-ladenness**                         | Observations are shaped by prior theoretical assumptions.                                             |
| **Holism vs. Reductionism**                  | Social systems can be approached as wholes or decomposed into parts.                                  |
| **Complexity and Uncertainty**               | Social systems are adaptive, nonlinear, and indeterminate.                                            |
| **Historicity / Temporality**                | Social systems evolve through time and history.                                                       |
| **Symbolic Mediation**                       | Social life is mediated by symbolic systems (language, money, laws).                                  |
| **Multi-level Structure**                    | Systems operate at micro (individual), meso (group), and macro (systemic) levels.                     |
| **Representation Fidelity**                  | Models should accurately depict relevant actors, norms, structures, and technologies.                 |
| **Dynamic Interaction**                      | Feedback loops and emergent properties arise from agent-structure interplay.                          |
| **Adaptation and Learning**                  | Agents and systems evolve through learning and self-organization.                                     |
| **Embeddedness**                             | Social systems are situated within broader ecological, technological, and institutional environments. |
| **Openness & Boundary Clarity**              | Systems exchange resources and information with their environment but still require boundaries.       |
| **Heterogeneity**                            | Social systems include diverse agents with varying goals, constraints, and behaviors.                 |
| **Anti-reification**                         | Models should not treat dynamic social constructs as fixed or natural.                                |
| **Empirical Grounding**       | Base models on observable evidence and measurable data.                                 |
| **Falsifiability**            | Models must be testable and potentially disprovable by evidence.                        |
| **Parsimony (Occam’s Razor)** | Prefer the simplest model that adequately explains observations.                        |
| **Coherence**                 | Ensure internal consistency and alignment with established knowledge.                   |
| **Contextual Awareness**      | Acknowledge the influence of context (cultural, temporal, situational) on observations. |
| **Provisionality**            | Treat models as tentative approximations, not absolute truths.                          |
| **Reproducibility**           | Observations and model outcomes must be replicable by independent observers.            |
| **Holistic Perspective**      | Consider systems as interconnected wholes, not isolated parts.                          |
| **Reflexivity**               | Critically examine how the observer’s assumptions and methods shape the model.          |
| **Pragmatic Utility**         | Prioritize models that enable effective prediction, intervention, or understanding.     |
| **Causal Adequacy**           | Include mechanisms that plausibly generate observed effects.                            |
| **Conceptual Clarity**        | Define all core terms, categories, and constructs unambiguously.                        |
| **Abstraction Discipline**    | Use abstraction to manage complexity without distorting essentials.                     |
| **Iterative Refinement**      | Knowledge develops through successive cycles of model adjustment and testing.           |
| **Epistemic Humility**        | Acknowledge limits of the model and of human understanding.                             |
| **Pluralism**                 | Incorporate multiple perspectives, disciplines, or methodologies.                       |



### Caution

> See more in [A Guide to Modelling Social Reality](../Breviarium/a-guide-to-modelling-social-reality.md).

> aka. Emergence Beyond the Obvious.

> Because social systems are directly observable to the human eye—unlike, for example, molecular systems—this immediacy of observation often leads to a false sense of intelligibility. Yet, at this level of organization, social systems are among the most complex phenomena in existence, due to the presence of adaptation, learning, strategic interaction, and the fact that nearly all meaningful patterns are emergent rather than reducible to simple components.

> Social systems may appear intelligible because they’re visible, but they are fundamentally complex and opaque due to emergent behavior and dynamic learning.
