# Nationalism

> A sociopolitical ideology and systemic orientation characterized by the assertion and mobilization of a perceived congruence between a population (defined by shared cultural, linguistic, historical, or ethnic traits) and a sovereign political unit (the nation-state), often manifesting as a demand for self-determination, territorial integrity, and the prioritization of national interests in governance, policy, and identity formation.

>  **Nationalism** is best understood as a **complex, multilevel system of identity formation, boundary enforcement, and power assertion**, rooted in sociocultural constructs and operationalized through institutional mechanisms aiming at aligning a political entity (state) with a collective identity (nation).

## Ontological Basis

* **Nation**: A constructed or emergent collective identity based on real or imagined commonalities (e.g., ethnicity, language, culture, religion, history).
* **State**: A political-legal entity with monopoly over legitimate violence within a defined territory (per Weber).
* **Nation-State**: A state whose territorial boundaries and governance are intended to align with the culturally defined boundaries of a nation.

## Functional Mechanisms

 * **Boundary Construction**: Creation and maintenance of symbolic and material distinctions between "us" (the nation) and "others."
 * **Cultural Standardization**: Through language policy, education, media, and historical narrative to enforce a coherent national identity.
 * **Political Instrumentalization**: Use of nationalism by political elites for legitimacy, social mobilization, or consolidation of power.
 * **Sovereignty Claim**: Assertion of political autonomy and right to self-rule, often vis-à-vis colonial, imperial, or supranational structures.

## Typologies (technical distinctions)

* **Ethnic Nationalism**: Nationhood based on common ancestry, culture, and bloodline (e.g., Johann Gottlieb Fichte).
* **Civic Nationalism**: Nationhood based on shared political values and civic participation (e.g., French republican model).
* **State-led Nationalism**: Nation-building efforts initiated by state apparatus (e.g., Meiji Japan).
* **Anti-Colonial Nationalism**: Movement against foreign domination aiming to establish national sovereignty (e.g., Indian independence movement).

## Systems-Theoretic View

* **Nationalism as an Autopoietic System**: A self-reproducing communicative system (per Niklas Luhmann) that generates legitimacy, identity, and boundaries through recursive operations of national discourse.
* **Feedback Mechanisms**: Nationalist sentiment shapes and is shaped by institutional arrangements, media systems, and international structures (e.g., globalization, diaspora networks).
