# The Policy-Politics Conflation Hypothesis: Language Structure and Development Outcomes

> Conjecture: Languages that do not lexically distinguish between policy (purposeful, instrumental action) and politics (power negotiation and contestation) may constrain institutional clarity and strategic governance capacity, leading to weaker long-term development outcomes. The fusion of power and action in language may reflect or reinforce systemic confusion between governance and partisanship.

QA:

- What are the implications of conflating strategic action (policy) with power struggle (politics) in governance?

- In what ways could the structure of language affect institutional cognition, particularly the ability to distinguish between strategic governance and political contestation?

- Do translation artifacts (e.g., "public policy" translated as "política pública") obscure technical meanings across languages?

- Is there a correlation between lexical conflation (e.g., one word for both concepts) and lower governance quality or development indicators?

- Do countries with a clear linguistic separation between policy and politics have more stable or effective public institutions?

- Does a lexical fusion reduce the cognitive space for long-term strategic planning?

- Which datasets (e.g., World Bank Governance Indicators, WGI; WVS; linguistic typologies) can support empirical testing of the hypothesis?
