# Good

> A **good** is a tangible product or service that satisfies a consumer's needs or desires and has value in exchange for money or other consideration.

> A good is ontologically flexible: it may be part of the environment (as a latent resource), or part of the interaction system (as an object of control, use, or exchange). This dual positioning depends on control, symbolic framing, and system boundaries.
