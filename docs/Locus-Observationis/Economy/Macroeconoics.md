# Macro Economic

> **Macroeconomics** is the branch of economics that studies the behavior, performance, and structure of an economy as a whole, rather than individual markets.

> Macroeconomics seeks to understand how these aggregate variables interact and influence economic stability, growth, and cycles, providing insights for policymakers to manage economic performance.

It focuses on aggregate indicators and phenomena such as:
* **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** and overall economic growth
* **Unemployment rates**
* **Inflation and price levels**
* **Monetary and fiscal policy**
* **Aggregate demand and supply**
* **National income and expenditure**
* **International trade and finance at the aggregate level**

## School

### Keynesian Economics

> **Keynesian economics** is a **macroeconomic theory** advocating for government intervention, particularly through fiscal policy, to manage aggregate demand and stabilize the economy, with a focus on achieving full employment and economic growth.


Several fundamental principles and policy tools characterize the Keynesian framework of economic policy:

1. **Aggregate Demand Management**: Keynesian economics emphasizes managing aggregate demand to achieve full employment and stable economic growth. Policies focus on stimulating demand during economic downturns and cooling down demand during periods of inflation or overheating.
2. **Fiscal Policy**: Keynesian policy advocates for active fiscal policy, where the government adjusts its spending and taxation levels to stabilize the economy. During recessions, governments increase spending or reduce taxes to boost demand and create jobs, while during periods of inflation, they may decrease spending or raise taxes to restrain demand.
3. **Counter-Cyclical Policies**: Keynesian economics emphasizes using counter-cyclical policies to offset fluctuations in the business cycle. Governments intervene to smooth out economic fluctuations by adopting expansionary policies during recessions and contractionary policies during booms.
4. **Public Investment**: Keynesian policy supports public investment in infrastructure, education, healthcare, and other sectors to stimulate economic activity and promote long-term growth. Public investment creates jobs, boosts demand in the short term, and enhances productivity and capacity in the long term.
5. **Monetary Policy Coordination**: While fiscal policy is central to the Keynesian framework, it also recognizes the role of monetary policy in managing the economy. Keynesian economists advocate for coordination between fiscal and monetary authorities to achieve macroeconomic stability and promote full employment.
6. **Role of Government**: Keynesian economics assigns an active role to government in stabilizing the economy and addressing market failures. Governments intervene to correct deficiencies in aggregate demand, provide public goods, regulate markets, and ensure social welfare.
7. **Income Distribution**: Keynesian policy considers income distribution and social welfare as essential objectives. Policies aim to reduce income inequality, alleviate poverty, and ensure equitable access to opportunities through progressive taxation, social safety nets, and targeted spending programs.

### New Keynesian Economics

> **New Keynesian Economics** is a modern school of macroeconomic thought that builds on traditional Keynesian ideas by incorporating microeconomic foundations and rational expectations. It aims to explain why markets may fail to clear instantly, leading to **price and wage rigidities** that cause short-run economic fluctuations.

**Key Features:**

* **Price and wage stickiness:** Prices and wages adjust slowly due to contracts, menu costs, and institutional factors.
* **Imperfect competition:** Firms have some price-setting power rather than being price takers.
* **Rational expectations:** Agents form expectations based on all available information.
* **Role of monetary policy:** Central banks can influence real output and employment in the short run by managing interest rates.
* **Nominal rigidities cause real effects:** Sticky prices mean that monetary shocks affect real variables, not just inflation.

### Post-Keynesian Economics

> **Post-Keynesian Economics** is a heterodox economic school that extends and critiques mainstream Keynesian thought. It emphasizes **fundamental uncertainty, the role of effective demand, and the non-neutrality of money** in the economy. It challenges the assumptions of perfect competition and rational expectations, focusing on real-world economic dynamics and institutions.

**Key Features:**

* **Fundamental uncertainty:** The future is inherently unpredictable, affecting investment and consumption decisions.
* **Effective demand:** Demand determines output and employment in the medium and long run, not just prices.
* **Endogenous money:** Money supply is determined by the demand for credit, not exogenously controlled by central banks.
* **Role of institutions:** Emphasizes the importance of social, political, and financial institutions in shaping economic outcomes.
* **Income distribution:** Focuses on how income distribution affects aggregate demand and economic stability.
* **Rejection of equilibrium:** Markets may not clear automatically; economies can be in persistent disequilibrium.
