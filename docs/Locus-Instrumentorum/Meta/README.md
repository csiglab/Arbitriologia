# Meta Theory

A set of high-level, indirect descriptions of reality that guide its modeling. The nature of observation can be understood in terms of levels of indirection:

- **Indirection of reality itself**: Observing reality through layers or abstractions inherent in the system being studied.

- **Indirection of mental representation**: Observing reality through layers of abstraction introduced by the observerâ€™s cognitive or conceptual representation.
