# Observer

> Remember: The position of a researcher is that of an external observer. Be explicit about the observerâ€™s position to properly localize reflexivity.

## Case Study

> Suppose we are studying a city; the city government within that space acts as an internal observer, while we, as researchers, occupy the role of an external observer.

> Recognizing and distinguishing these observer positions is essential for understanding different perspectives and the reflexive nature of social analysis.
