# Mechanism Design

: 16

> **Mechanism design**, a field within economic theory that addresses how to achieve desired objectives in systems with strategic agents who have their own interests, has been shaped by many significant papers.
> 

> Below is a table of some of the main papers in mechanism design, outlining key contributions and authors.
> 

> **Incentive Systems Models** refer to frameworks or structures designed to **motivate and influence behavior within an organization or society** by using a variety of incentives, such as rewards, penalties, or recognition, to encourage specific actions or outcomes.
> 

> An I**ncentive System** is a mechanism that **motivates agents** to **choose actions** from a **subset of an action space** to get positive rewards. The system is designed in such a way that if successful, then particular objects are archived.
> 

> An I**ncentive System** can be considered a form of feedback system within the context of organizational behavior and economics. Incentives provide feedback to individuals or entities based on their actions or performance, influencing future behavior.
> 

> **Incentive System** is a **feedback system based technology** to **align the goals and behavior** of agents**(part)** with a super structure **(whole)**.

Here's how **incentives and feedback systems** are connected:

1. **Causal Relationship: T**here is a cause-and-effect relationship in both incentive and feedback systems. Actions or behaviors lead to specific outcomes, and the system provides feedback in response to those actions.
2. **Behavior Modification:** Incentive systems are designed to modify behavior by reinforcing desired actions or outcomes. Similarly, feedback systems provide information about the consequences of past behavior, influencing individuals to adjust their actions accordingly.
3. **Continuous Improvement:** Both incentive and feedback systems contribute to constant improvement. Individuals receive feedback through incentives or information about their performance, guiding them to improve or maintain certain behaviors.
4. **Goal Alignment:** Incentive systems are often aligned with specific goals or objectives. Similarly, feedback systems provide information about the extent to which goals are achieved, helping individuals understand the alignment between their actions and organizational objectives.
5. **Performance Evaluation:** Incentives are performance evaluations that reward individuals for achieving specific targets or outcomes. Feedback systems, more broadly, provide performance information, allowing individuals to gauge their effectiveness and make adjustments.

While the terms are not always used interchangeably, the concept of feedback is inherent in operating incentive systems. Effective incentive systems rely on clear communication of expectations, timely feedback, and the alignment of rewards with desired behaviors. In this way, incentive systems contribute to a feedback loop that shapes individual and organizational behavior over time.

| **Year** | **Authors** | **Title** | **Contribution** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1961 | Ronald Coase | "The Problem of Social Cost" | This paper explores how private and social costs can be reconciled through appropriate rights allocations, laying the groundwork for later work in mechanism design. |
| 1973 | Leonid Hurwicz | "The Design of Mechanisms for Resource Allocation" | One of the first formal analyses of mechanism design introduces concepts used to ensure efficient resource allocation despite self-interested agents. |
| 1979 | Roger Myerson | "Incentive Compatibility and the Bargaining Problem" | Introduces Myerson's seminal work on incentive compatibility, providing a foundation for designing mechanisms that align individual incentives with social goals. |
| 1981 | Eric Maskin | "An Auction Theory Approach to Economic Planning" | Expands on applying auction theory to economic planning, offering a method for aligning incentives in public and decentralized decision-making. |
| 1982 | Leonid Hurwicz, Eric Maskin, Roger Myerson | "Efficient Mechanisms for Bilateral Trading" | It focuses on trading mechanisms and analyzes how private information impacts the efficiency of trades. |
| 1985 | Drew Fudenberg, Jean Tirole | "A 'Signal-Jamming' Theory of Predation" | Applies game theory to business strategy, particularly in competitive environments, influencing subsequent mechanism design applications. |
| 1994 | John Moore, Rafael Repullo | "Subgame Perfect Implementation" | Develops a framework for implementing desired outcomes in dynamic games, enhancing the understanding of strategic interactions over time. |
| 2001 | Dirk Bergemann, Juuso Valimaki | "Dynamic Mechanism Design: An Introduction" | Provides an introduction to dynamic aspects of mechanism design, considering how information and options evolve over time. |
| 2007 | Paul Milgrom | "Putting Auction Theory to Work: The Simultaneous Ascending Auction" | Details the practical application of auction theory to real-world problems, specifically telecommunications spectrum auctions. |
| 2011 | Ilya Segal, Michael Whinston | "Property Rights and the Efficiency of Bargaining" | Examines how property rights influence bargaining outcomes, an essential aspect of mechanism design in legal and economic frameworks. |

These papers contribute to various aspects of mechanism design, from theoretical foundations to economic planning and auction applications. They are fundamental for anyone interested in strategically designing rules and protocols to achieve specific objectives in games or markets.
