## R&D Actors

As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I can provide a general overview of Poland's research and development (R&D) actors. Remember that the landscape may have changed, and new organizations may have emerged since then. Here are some key R&D actors in Poland:

1. **National Science Center (NCN):** The NCN is a governmental agency supporting fundamental research across various disciplines in Poland.
2. **National Centre for Research and Development (NCBR):** NCBR is a government agency implementing national R&D programs and initiatives.
3. **Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN):** PAN is a major scientific institution in Poland, comprising a network of research institutes and centers covering various scientific disciplines.
4. **Ministry of Science and Higher Education:** The government ministry responsible for science and higher education policies, funding, and coordination of R&D activities.
5. **National Information Processing Institute (OPI PIB):** OPI PIB is involved in information technology research and development, focusing on applications in various sectors.
6. **Wrocław Technology Park:** An example of a technology park in Poland that facilitates collaboration between businesses, academia, and research institutions to drive innovation.
7. **Łukasiewicz Research Network:** Formerly known as the **Institute of Precision Mechanics**, it is part of the Łukasiewicz Research Network, which consists of numerous research institutes covering various fields.
8. **Innovation and Industry Liaison Office (IILO):** Many universities in Poland, such as Warsaw University of Technology and Jagiellonian University, have offices dedicated to fostering collaboration between academia and industry.
9. **Science and Technology Parks:** Various science and technology parks across the country provide infrastructure and support for R&D activities. Examples include Gdańsk Science and Technology Park and Poznań Science and Technology Park.
10. **European Funds:** Poland also receives funding from European Union research programs, such as Horizon Europe, which supports R&D initiatives.

## GDP Measurement

While World Bank claims Poland has twice GDP per capita of China, if you look at these indicators, it appears that Chinese living standards are higher.

Poland's living standards appear to be, in fact, midway between China's and Mexico's (note I corrected Poland's energy consumption, the previous datapoint of 0.065 was the Romanian level).

![alt text](poland-metrics.png)

> Mean years of schooling of China is strange, 8.1 yrs (HDI data) are even lower than Congo. 2020 census puts it at 9.5 years (>25yrs old). HDI in 2018 also mysteriously used 7.8 years from the Barro & Lee (2016) which itself says 7.8 is 2005’s level and it was 8.14 yrs in 2015.

> several of these indicators like  electricity generation per capita, energy consumption per capita relate rather to the industry contribution to GDP than to the standard of living

> Their correlation with GDP per capita is higher than years of schooling, the only indicator where Poland performs better than China.

> Also, energy/electricity consumption tends to be higher in countries with low population density like US and Canada. South Korea and Germany are much more industrialized but consume less electricity.

> I agree they can be misleading. Thats why I presented eight indicators besides one.

> The point of the exercise is to show that even GDP PPP can also be misleading.

> You can get a “sugar high” in growth by pushing fertility very low, below replacement People work a lot, save the money, and to the extent they have kids, invest a lot in a few kids While this turbo charges growth, it’s hard to get out of the resulting low fertility equilibrium
