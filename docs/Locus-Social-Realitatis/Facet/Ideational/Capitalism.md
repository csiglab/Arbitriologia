## History

> Parxis of Capitalism Before Conceptualization:

> What is the history of the term?

> What has the term denoted over time?

> What does the term denote today?

### Capital

> What has the term denoted over time?

> Note: We must distinguish concepts from reality: the different denotations of capital existed in practice long before they were conceptually articulated.

| **Antiquity (Latin usage)**                     | Head, principal, chief amount (*capitale*) | Refers to the principal or stock, often in legal and accounting contexts; not yet an economic category. |
| **Medieval Europe**                             | Movable wealth, money, livestock           | Capital denotes wealth used in trade; strongly linked to mercantile activity and commercial risk.       |
| **Mercantilist Era (16th–18th c.)**             | Money invested in commerce                 | Emphasis on trade finance, bullion accumulation, and circulation rather than production.                |
| **Early Classical Economics (late 18th c.)**    | Accumulated wealth used productively       | Shift from money to productive assets (tools, machinery, materials).                                    |
| **Classical Political Economy (Smith–Ricardo)** | Produced means of production               | Capital distinguished from land and labor; central to productivity and distribution.                    |
| **Marxian Political Economy (mid-19th c.)**     | Self-expanding value; social relation      | Capital is not a thing but a dynamic relation enabling surplus extraction.                              |
| **Neoclassical Economics (late 19th–20th c.)**  | Factor of production                       | Capital abstracted into a measurable stock contributing to output via marginal productivity.            |
| **Keynesian / Monetary Economics (20th c.)**    | Financial assets enabling investment       | Focus on capital as money and financial claims influencing aggregate demand.                            |
| **Late 20th–21st c. Economics**                 | Physical, human, and intellectual assets   | Concept broadens to include skills, knowledge, and intangible productive capacities.                    |

### Capitalism

> “Ancient markets were like a layer of foam on the deep sea of traditional society; capitalism is when the foam becomes the sea itself.”
> — Fernand Braudel

> Braudel’s metaphor is evocative but analytically imprecise. Even in contemporary societies—including the Nordic economies—markets do not constitute the totality of social or economic coordination: many goods and services are organized through non-market mechanisms such as public provision, household production, and institutional allocation. Conversely, numerous pre-modern societies—particularly urban and mercantile ones—were already deeply commercial and, in some cases, predominantly non-agricultural. Markets, cities, and extensive trade networks long predate the used of the term `capitalism`.

> **Note**: There is no such thing as capitalism as a concrete, unified entity. What exists instead is a highly abstract schema: a recursive production–revenue–reinvestment loop, coupled with an equally abstract representation of market exchange. These abstractions are then projected onto historically diverse and institutionally heterogeneous societies, giving the appearance of a single, coherent “system” where, in reality, there are only variable configurations of practices, constraints, and coordination mechanisms.

> Neither the **market system** nor **“capitalism,”** in general, possesses a predefined or canonical form. Both are best understood as highly abstract schemas that can be instantiated in a wide variety of institutional, legal, technological, and cultural configurations. The same underlying abstractions—market exchange, capital accumulation, reinvestment—admit multiple concrete realizations rather than a single necessary structure.

> Note: In a relatively `free market system`, reinvestment tends to occur almost automatically as demand increases; it emerges by default as an immediate response to expanding market opportunities.

> **Note**: There are different instances of the same abstract schema—market exchange combined with surplus reinvestment—in which the default configuration is one where reinvestment primarily drives market expansion rather than productive transformation.

> Note: This table contains significant inaccuracies and overgeneralizations in its characterization of market and reinvestment phenomena, fabricating discrete historical “stages” (e.g., mercantilism) and failing to disaggregate heterogeneous cases such as medieval merchant cities.

| **Period**                                                | **Denotation**                                    | **Note**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| **Antiquity (Greek–Roman world)**                         | No unified concept; episodic capital accumulation | Extensive markets, credit, banking, and profit-seeking existed, but reinvestment cycles were socially subordinated to status, land, and political power. Accumulation was real but not generalized nor institutionally autonomous.                                     |
| **Medieval Europe (c. 1000–1500)**                        | Commercial accumulation within feudal constraints | Capitalist practices (merchant capital, bills of exchange, profit reinvestment) expand in cities and trade networks, but surplus is structurally constrained by feudal rents, guild regulation, and political privilege.                                               |
| **Early Modern Commercial Era (c. 1500–1700)**            | Merchant capitalism                               | Capitalism denotes long-distance trade, colonial extraction, chartered companies, and financial innovation. Reinvestment cycles exist but are focused on circulation and arbitrage rather than systematic transformation of production.                                |
| **Mercantilist Era (17th–18th c.)**                       | State-linked accumulation regime                  | Capitalism increasingly associated with national accumulation strategies, monopoly privileges, and trade surpluses. Capital accumulation is real, but reinvestment is heavily mediated by state power and geopolitical competition.                                    |
| **Classical Political Economy (late 18th–early 19th c.)** | Productive reinvestment system                    | Capitalism begins to denote a generalized process where surplus is systematically reinvested into production, increasing productivity through machinery, division of labor, and scale. This is the first clear abstraction of capitalism as a coherent economic logic. |
| **Industrial Capitalism (19th c.)**                       | Self-sustaining reinvestment loop                 | Capitalism denotes a dominant social logic: profits → reinvestment → expanded production → wage labor reproduction. The reinvestment schema becomes structurally autonomous and socially hegemonic.                                                                    |
| **Marxian Usage (mid–late 19th c.)**                      | Historical mode of production                     | Capitalism is defined as a historically specific social relation centered on capital’s self-expansion via wage labor and surplus extraction. Emphasis shifts from markets to the internal logic of accumulation and reproduction.                                      |
| **Early 20th Century (Weber, Schumpeter)**                | Rationalized accumulation and innovation system   | Capitalism denotes disciplined reinvestment guided by calculation, accounting, and innovation. Entrepreneurial recombination and institutional rationalization become central, rather than mere ownership or markets.                                                  |
| **Postwar Era (Keynesian–Fordist)**                       | Managed accumulation regime                       | Capitalism is understood as a system requiring macroeconomic management to stabilize investment and reinvestment cycles. The reinvestment schema persists but is institutionally buffered by the state.                                                                |
| **Late 20th Century (Neoliberal period)**                 | Financialized reinvestment logic                  | Capitalism increasingly denotes capital circulation through financial markets, with reinvestment often decoupled from productive expansion and redirected toward asset appreciation and rent extraction.                                                               |
| **Early 21st Century**                                    | Abstract accumulation schema across domains       | Capitalism denotes a generalized reinvestment logic applied beyond industry—to data, platforms, intellectual property, human attention, and state-backed rents. The abstraction survives even as productive reinvestment weakens.                                      |
