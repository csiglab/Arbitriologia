# Strategists and Development Thinkers

> **Note**: Thinkers operate within broader ecosystems of ideas. It is rare for radically different concepts to emerge in isolation. The smaller the intellectual or institutional environment, the lower the probability of divergence. Therefore, this list does not account for the intellectual history or context in which these ideas emerged.
