# Industry-University Cooperative Research Centers (IUCRC)

> Pre-competitive multi-stakeholder research consortia with pooled industrial membership funding under a public‚Äìprivate cooperative governance model.

> Industry‚ÄìUniversity Cooperative Research Centers (IUCRCs) are collaborative partnerships designed to bridge academic research and industrial innovation, primarily funded and structured under the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), although similar models exist globally.

## Basic Structure

- University-led center: A university (or consortium of universities) hosts the center.
- Industry members: Companies and organizations become members by paying annual fees and participating in research planning.
- NSF funding: The NSF provides seed funding and support to establish the center, with the goal of becoming self-sustaining.
- Collaborative research: Projects are jointly proposed, selected, and executed by academic researchers and industry members.

## Funding Model

| Source                             | Purpose                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| üßë‚Äçüî¨ **NSF Grant**                | Seed funding (e.g., planning grant, startup funding) |
| üè¢ **Industry Fees**               | Main ongoing support (membership dues)               |
| üèõÔ∏è **University Support**         | Facilities, admin, partial staffing                  |
| üîÅ **Matching or leveraged funds** | From state agencies, federal labs, other grants      |

## Project Lifecycle & Governance

### Center Formation

- Universities apply for NSF Planning Grant.
- Recruit industrial partners.
- Host a planning meeting to align interests.

### Operational Model

- Research projects are proposed by university faculty.
- Industry Advisory Board (IAB) (composed of member companies) votes on which projects to fund.
- Projects must be pre-competitive, meaning results are shared openly among members.

### Execution

- Faculty and graduate students carry out the research.
- Industry mentors often provide guidance and real-world data.

### Intellectual Property (IP)

- Results are published or shared with all members.
- Members receive non-exclusive, royalty-free licenses.
- Additional rights (e.g., exclusive licenses) may be negotiated.
