> **Financial economics** is a branch of economics that examines how financial decisions are made in markets, considering factors such as risk, return, asset pricing, and the allocation of resources over time.

> **Financial** modeling is the process of creating mathematical representations of financial situations or scenarios to make informed business decisions.

> The **financial system** is a complex network of institutions, markets, and regulations that facilitates the flow of funds and enables the allocation of resources within an economy.

> The word “**finance**” is derived from the French word “finance,” which means “to provide funds” or “to finance.” It ultimately traces back to the Latin word “finis,” meaning “end” or “limit,” which evolved to refer to settling debts or reaching an agreement.

> **Finance** plays a crucial role in an economy by providing the necessary capital, facilitating transactions, allocating resources, managing risk, and promoting economic growth and stability. It enables individuals, businesses, and governments to save, invest, borrow, and manage their financial resources effectively, contributing to the overall functioning and development of the economy. Additionally, finance institutions such as banks, stock exchanges, and insurance companies facilitate the flow of funds, support economic activities, and provide financial services that are essential for economic growth, investment, and risk management.

## Techniques

> A financial modeling technique refers to a specific method or approach used to create mathematical representations of financial situations or scenarios for analysis, forecasting, and decision-making purposes.
> 

> A financial model is a mathematical representation or framework that captures key financial variables, relationships, and assumptions to analyze and forecast financial performance, evaluate investment opportunities, and make informed business decisions.
> 

> **Financial models** are quantitative tools used to analyze and forecast financial performance, make investment decisions, assess risk, and evaluate various scenarios. They are designed to represent the relationships between different financial variables and provide insights into the potential outcomes of specific financial decisions.

## Arbitrage

Given two markets selling an identical good, an arbitrage exists if the good can profitably be bought in one market and sold at a profit in the other. This model is simple on its face, but can present itself in disguised forms: The only gas station in a 50-mile radius is also an arbitrage as it can buy gasoline and sell it at the desired profit (temporarily) without interference. Nearly all arbitrage situations eventually disappear as they are discovered and exploited.
