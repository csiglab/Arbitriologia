# Social Theory

> A note that **dives deep** into social structures; underlying ideas systems; normative frameworks (personal & collective).
> 

> A **Philosophical Account** of the Foundational Aspects of Human Existence and Practice.
> 

> **Social theory** often investigates how **idea systems** (also referred to as **ideologies**, **belief systems**, **cultural frameworks**, or **worldviews**) shape and influence **social structures**.
> 

> **Social Theory**: Analyze the relationship between **idea systems** and **social structures** by **reverse-engineering social structures** (or society itself). This involves examining how social structures and practices inform and shape the underlying idea systems, values, and ideologies that support them.
> 

> **Collective Frameworks**: Structured sets of shared norms, values, beliefs, and goals that regulate, guide, and stabilize the behavior of groups or entire societies. They define "what matters" and "what is right" at the level of the collective.
> 

> **Personal Frameworks**:	Internalized systems of meaning, value, and behavioral rules that an individual uses to interpret the world, regulate action, and orient life goals. They operate at the level of the self.
> 

> **Human**:  A biological organism of species Homo sapiens, characterized by self-consciousness, symbolic reasoning, sociality, and the capacity to generate and be governed by frameworks of meaning and normativity.
> 

> **Sociology**: The scientific study of social behavior, institutions, structures, and collective frameworks. Sociology seeks to understand how societies are organized, maintained, and transformed over time.
> 

> **Anthropology**:  The holistic study of humans across time and space, encompassing biological, cultural, linguistic, and archaeological perspectives. In relation to frameworks, anthropology examines both collective and personal systems of meaning across diverse cultures.

> **Society**: 	A structured, organized network of human relations, institutions, and cultural systems, bound together by shared frameworks, practices, and modes of cooperation or conflict. Society is the medium in which collective frameworks are instantiated.

## Social Theory

> Note:  Collective Theories + Individual Theories.
> 

> **Social Theory** is the systematic framework for analyzing, modeling, and explaining the structures, processes, and dynamics of social life. It seeks to abstract key principles governing the formation, maintenance, and transformation of social relations, institutions, and collective behaviors, often employing conceptual, logical, and empirical methodologies. Social theory can be formal or critical, descriptive or normative, and may integrate models from philosophy, economics, political science, anthropology, and sociology.
