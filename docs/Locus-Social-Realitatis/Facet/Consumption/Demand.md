# Demand

**Economic demand** refers to the **willingness and ability of consumers to purchase a good or service at various prices over a given period of time**.

> **Demand** is a dispositional relational property instantiated in interaction units (e.g., agents, consumers) toward economic objects (goods/services), modulated by contextual variables.

## Ontological Signature

> **Demand and supply** are emergent relational dispositions of economic systems, arising from the structured interactions of agents under conditions of scarcity, preferences, and constraints.

## Key Components

1. **Willingness** – The consumer *wants* the good or service.
2. **Ability to pay** – The consumer has the *financial means* to make the purchase.
3. **Price sensitivity** – Demand depends on the *price*: usually, as price falls, demand rises (all else equal).
4. **Time frame** – Demand is always considered over a *specific time period* (e.g., per day, per year).
5. **Ceteris paribus** – The standard analysis assumes *other factors remain constant* (e.g., income, tastes, prices of substitutes).

## Formulation

$$
Q_d = f(P, I, P_s, T, E, ...)
$$

Where:

* $Q_d$ = quantity demanded (demand function)
* $P$ = price of the good
* $I$ = income
* $P_s$ = price of substitutes or complements
* $T$ = tastes/preferences
* $E$ = expectations about future prices

## Types of Demand

* **Individual Demand**: Demand of a single consumer.
* **Market Demand**: Aggregate demand from all consumers in a market.
* **Effective Demand**: Demand backed by actual purchasing power.
* **Latent Demand**: A want or need not backed by purchasing power.

## Aggregate Demand

> Aggregate demand (AD) is an **economic measure** representing the total demand for goods and services in an economy at a given overall price level and in a given period.

### Components of Aggregate Demand

> The aggregate demand formula is typically represented as:  $AD = C + I + G + (X - M)$

Aggregate demand is composed of the following components:

1. **Consumption (C)**: The household spending on goods and services.
2. **Investment (I)**: The spending by businesses on capital goods like machinery and buildings and households on residential properties.
3. **Government Spending (G)**: The total expenditure by the government on goods and services.
4. **Net Exports (NX)**: The value of a country’s exports minus its imports (NX = Exports - Imports).

### Role in Economic Analysis

Aggregate demand plays a crucial role in economic analysis and policy-making:

- **Macroeconomic Equilibrium**: When combined with aggregate supply, it helps determine the equilibrium level of output and prices in an economy.
- **Economic Fluctuations**: Changes in aggregate demand can lead to economic fluctuations, influencing levels of employment and inflation.
- **Policy Implications**: Policymakers use aggregate demand to design fiscal and monetary policies. For instance, to counteract a recession, they might increase government spending or cut taxes to boost AD.

### Factors Influencing Aggregate Demand

Several factors can influence the components of aggregate demand:

- **Consumer Confidence**: Higher consumer confidence can increase consumption.
- **Interest Rates**: Lower interest rates can boost investment and consumption by making borrowing cheaper.
- **Government Policies**: Fiscal policies like tax cuts or increased public spending can raise aggregate demand.
- **Foreign Exchange Rates**: A weaker domestic currency can make exports cheaper and imports more expensive, potentially increasing net exports.

In summary, **aggregate demand** is an essential economic measure that captures the total spending on an economy’s goods and services and is critical for understanding overall economic activity and guiding economic policies.

## Properties

> Demand and supply are systemic dispositions characterized by properties that govern their quantities, sensitivities, constraints, and interactions within economic environments.

## Supply/Demand Model

> **The Supply/Demand toy model** a theory of **economic exchange;** production and consumption.
>

> This toy models is only an **effective model** it’s does not go into the details of production;  for example technological change; giving this model only usfeullness given a static technological setting.
>

> Demand elasticity is a concept in economics that refers to how sensitive the quantity demanded of a good or service is to changes in other economic factors, such as price, income, or the price of related goods.
>

> Supply creates it’s on demand - Say Law (It’s not a lot but is something that happens in many cases; when we need to find better ways to produce; make the supply happens; meaning this is new demand  to be used in the supply process).
>

### Breviarium

- Supply/Demand is a coordination model or exchange mechanism model.
- It represents how Interaction Units (buyers and sellers) adjust behavior based on price signals under constraints (budget, production capacity).
- It requires supporting institutions (markets), artifacts (prices, contracts), and regulations.

#### Model Structure

- Demand Curve: Shows how quantity demanded changes with price (usually downward sloping).
- Supply Curve: Shows how quantity supplied changes with price (usually upward sloping).
- Equilibrium: Where the two curves intersect — determines market price and quantity.
- Shocks: External changes (e.g. taxes, technology, preferences) can shift supply/demand.

### Demand

Several consumer demand models are used in economics and marketing to analyze and understand consumer behavior. Here are a few examples:

- **The Law of Demand**: The Law of Demand states that as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa. This inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded is a fundamental principle in economics.
- **The Engel Curve**: The Engel Curve shows the relationship between consumer income and the quantity demanded of a good or service. As income increases, consumers buy more specific goods and services, such as luxury items or travel.
- **The Utility Function**: The Utility Function is a mathematical model that explains how consumers allocate their resources (i.e., money and time) to maximize their overall satisfaction or utility. It assumes that consumers choose based on their preferences and the available options and seek to maximize their utility subject to budget constraints.
- **The Theory of Planned Behavior**: The Theory of Planned Behavior is a model that explains how attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control influence consumer behavior. It posits that consumers are rational decision-makers considering various factors (such as social norms, beliefs, and attitudes) when purchasing.
- **The Diffusion of Innovation Model**: The Diffusion of Innovation Model explains how new products and ideas spread through a population over time. It identifies various types of consumers (such as innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards) and explains how different groups adopt new products or ideas at different rates.

### Supply

> …
>

### History

> If people do not consume a product or service, then there will not be anybody to supply that product or service for the sake of price - [Tirukkural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirukkural)
> 

> If desire for goods increases while its availability decreases, its price rises. On the other hand, if availability of the good increases and the desire for it decreases, the price comes down. - [Ibn Taymiyyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Taymiyyah).
> 

> It was not until 1767 that the phrase "supply and demand" was first used by Scottish writer James Denham-Steuart in his Inquiry into the Principles of Political Economy.  Previous ideas by Jhon Locke and Francis Hutcheson.
> 

### Limitations

- Strengths: The model is effective for understanding foundational economic concepts like price equilibrium and the market mechanism in a static world.
- Limitations: It is static, ignores technological progress, and over-simplifies real-world complexities such as market power, information asymmetry, and externalities.
- Works only for commodity competitive markets.
- Assumes a static technological setting.
