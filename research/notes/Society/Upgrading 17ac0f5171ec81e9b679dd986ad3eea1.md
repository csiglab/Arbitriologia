Government Grants and Direct Subsidies to Promote Firms’ Technological Learning Should be Restricted.

- **Different Incentives—**tax concessions, loans, and grants—have inherent advantages and disadvantages. Tax incentives have the benefit of being non-discriminatory: they are open to all firms that meet stated criteria, and administration is relatively simple. On the other hand, grants are generally more effective in promoting activities prioritized by the government, and, unlike tax incentives, they are less likely to subsidize activity that would have occurred in any case (Turpin et al., 2002).
- **Use of Grants in Taiwan**
    - Development of Targeted Leading Products (**DTLP**)
        - The government provided firms with a grant of 50% of total **product development** expenses to exceed the productivity level of firms in Taiwan.
    - Development of Critical Components and Products (**DCCP**)
        - It was approved in 1992 to develop crucial components and products with high value-added and development potential that would improve the industrial structure and substantially enhance the competitiveness of downstream industries. 66 components and parts were selected (Lauridsen, 1999).

- **Use in Singapore**:
    - **Innovation Voucher Scheme (IVS)**:  Provides SMEs with grants to pay for consultancy and technical services provided by local and reputable overseas universities and research institutes.
    - The government also uses this scheme to promote inter-firm collaboration by allowing up to 10 SMEs to pool their vouchers.
    - I am using the Innovation Scheme to create the habit of uniting forces to compete in **foreign markets**.
    - On the other hand, in **Thailand**, grant schemes to promote specific or targeted activities to enhance firms' technological learning were limited due to market distortion and rigid government regulations to stem corruption and cronyism. Therefore, Thailand needs the opportunity to use effective and more targeted policy tools to promote technological catch-ups and has to rely only on tax incentives, a blunt but easier-to-handle instrument.
