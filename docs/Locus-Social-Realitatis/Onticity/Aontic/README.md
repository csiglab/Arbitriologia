# Non Ontic Representation

> In this note, we explore an important concept in **agent modeling**: **Mental Constructs** - with a focus on the social reality. These are **internally generated concepts or ideas** that agents use to **represent, interpret, and reason about the world**.

> **Mental Constructs** are concepts or ideas that function as **internally constructed representations**. They serve a **representational purpose** at some level of abstraction from reality, helping agents interpret, model, or anticipate aspects of the external world, even though they are **not directly derived from reality**.

> **Agents—in** our case, humans—possess many concepts related to the social sphere of reality that do not correspond to tangible entities or ontological features of that reality. Concepts such as Justice or Progress are non-substantial. Nonetheless, these key concepts exist as shared mental representations among agents; they shape how we act and, ultimately, influence the structure and dynamics of social reality itself.

> For example; Idiology is not a mental construct - because it's related with realty in this case - the inner state of Agents.

## Case

| Mental Construct | Description                                                              | Use                                                                                                      | Criticism                                                                                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Modernity        | A framework emphasizing progress, rationality, and social transformation | Helps agents interpret social, economic, and technological change; guides development-oriented decisions | Can impose a linear view of history; may discourage experimentation and alternative approaches                |
| Nation           | Idea of a politically and culturally bounded community                   | Guides collective identity, political organization, and governance                                       | Often socially constructed; can be exclusionary or oversimplify complex social networks                       |
| Development      | Concept of improving social, economic, and technological conditions      | Helps agents prioritize policies, investments, and reforms                                               | Can be ethnocentric; risks imposing external models that ignore local capacities                              |
| Market           | Abstract representation of economic exchange mechanisms                  | Helps agents predict, coordinate, and optimize resource allocation                                       | Can mask power relations, inequalities, and informal economies                                                |
| Justice          | Normative concept of fairness and rights                                 | Guides legal, political, and social decision-making                                                      | Highly context-dependent; contested interpretations can produce conflict                                      |
| Legitimacy       | Perceived validity or acceptability of authority, rules, or institutions | Helps agents evaluate governance, compliance, and social order                                           | Subjective and socially constructed; may be fragile or contingent on specific cultural or historical contexts |
| Authority        | Socially recognized power to influence or command                        | Guides organizational hierarchies, decision-making, and compliance                                       | Can legitimize inequality; may be contested or unstable                                                       |
| Freedom          | Concept of individual or collective autonomy                             | Helps agents understand constraints, rights, and social obligations                                      | Highly context-dependent; can conflict with other social goals or collective interests                        |
