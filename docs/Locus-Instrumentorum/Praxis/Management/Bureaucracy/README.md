# Human Resource Unit (HRU) & System

> **Human Resource Management (HRM)** is the organizational function concerned with the systematic acquisition, development, deployment, governance, and reproduction of human capabilities in pursuit of organizational objectives.

> Wha tis the relation with Administration of an Organization? It's HRM part of the administartion? In the sense that adminmistration takes alrady the set of (agents) in order to coordinate them? An Organization has many administrative layer - or systems - 

How to design, evalute, and improve the administration of the **Human Resources Unit** - Across a Governmetn AGency adn across th government?

HR: Does not administer govermetn personal - each organization unit does that - HR adminit4rs the agents under the HR Agency - Organizational Unit that deals with a set of proceses realated with the ...

Functions:

- How many agents are needed?
- When and where are they needed?
- Which agents (skills, roles, constraints)?

- How is reality deviating from plan, and how do we correct it?

> Note: I Don't Understand teh Term 'Human Resource Management (HRM)' becuase this does not manage the resources actually - it just run a set of process and task to masure that Organizational Unit are well staff - and yes  -so this manaages the agents that execute those tasks - not the agents resources of other units.

| **Principle**       | **Merit-Based Appointment**<br>**Political Neutrality**<br>**Representative Bureaucracy**<br>**Proportionality**                             | Foundational axioms dictating *how* public HR decisions must be morally and legally grounded. Merit ensures selection by competence; neutrality guarantees service regardless of political regime; representativeness ensures workforce mirrors society; proportionality ensures means align with ends.            | Serves as constitutional constraints and ethical boundaries that prevent arbitrary, discriminatory, or politically weaponized personnel decisions. Acts as the non-negotiable "hard code" of legitimacy.                                 |
| **Doctrine**        | **Weberian Bureaucracy**<br>**New Public Management (NPM)**<br>**New Public Service (NPS)**<br>**Digital-Era Governance**                    | Established bodies of administrative theory prescribing the *structural logic* of public employment. Weber emphasizes hierarchy/lifetime tenure; NPM emphasizes performance contracts and private-sector mimicry; NPS emphasizes democratic citizenship and community service; DEG emphasizes data-driven agility. | Provides the paradigmatic lens through which HR systems are designed—determining whether the system prioritizes rule-following (Weber), results (NPM), deliberation (NPS), or algorithmic optimization (DEG).                            |
| **Operation Model** | **Career-Based Civil Service**<br>**Position-Based System**<br>**Mixed/Parallel Systems**<br>**Agencification**                              | The architectural blueprint for HR execution. Career systems emphasize entry-level recruitment and internal promotion; position systems treat each role as distinct and open; mixed systems combine elements; agencification creates arm's-length HR bodies.                                                       | Dictates resource allocation, career pathing, and mobility rules. Determines whether the organization builds talent internally (career) or buys it externally (position), fundamentally affecting institutional memory and adaptability. |
| **Philosophy**      | **Public Service Motivation (PSM)**<br>**Civic Republicanism**<br>**Utilitarian Public Interest**<br>**Professional Craftsmanship**          | Ontological assumptions about *why* public servants work and the nature of the "public good." PSM emphasizes intrinsic altruistic drive; civic republicanism emphasizes active citizenship duty; utilitarianism emphasizes outcome maximization; craftsmanship emphasizes excellence in professional practice.     | Shapes recruitment narratives, engagement strategies, and retention levers. Determines whether HR appeals to mission (PSM), duty (republicanism), impact metrics (utilitarian), or mastery (craftsmanship).                              |
| **Strategy**        | **Workforce Succession Planning**<br>**Competency-Based Management**<br>**Agile Talent Pipelines**<br>**Diversity & Inclusion Architecture** | Deliberate, long-term orientations toward capability acquisition and deployment. Succession planning mitigates demographic risk; competency mapping aligns skills with mission; agility enables rapid reallocation; D\&I architecture ensures cognitive diversity.                                                 | Translates abstract principles into temporal action plans. Determines how the organization anticipates future skill gaps, competes for scarce talent, and maintains operational continuity through leadership transitions.               |
| **Policy**             | **Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)**<br>**Conflict-of-Interest Rules**<br>**Performance Appraisal Policy**<br>**Remote Work Policy**      | High-level prescriptions that translate principles, doctrines, and philosophy into formal organizational commitments. Policies provide the "rules of the game" for public HR operations.                             | Constrains decision-making and ensures consistency. Provides official guidance for managers and staff to act in alignment with overarching principles and legal/regulatory requirements.                                                |
| **Procedure**          | **Job Requisition Process**<br>**Hiring & Onboarding Workflow**<br>**Performance Evaluation Cycle**<br>**Disciplinary Action Steps**        | Step-by-step instructions operationalizing policies. Procedures define *how* tasks are executed within the HR system, often including sequencing, responsible parties, and required documentation.                   | Ensures reproducibility and operational clarity. Reduces uncertainty and arbitrariness in executing HR tasks, enabling accountability and auditability.                                                                                 |
| **Benchmark**          | **Time-to-Hire Metrics**<br>**Promotion Rate Targets**<br>**Training Completion Standards**<br>**Employee Engagement Scores**               | Quantitative or qualitative reference points used to measure performance against policy and procedure. Benchmarks operationalize strategic objectives and allow monitoring of efficiency, effectiveness, and equity. | Provides evaluative feedback loops. Helps HR leadership identify gaps, validate process improvements, and guide resource allocation. Serves as a mechanism to measure alignment with doctrine, philosophy, and strategy.                |
| **Behavioral Pattern** | **Proactive Talent Coaching**<br>**Peer Recognition Practices**<br>**Cross-Functional Collaboration**<br>**Ethical Decision-Making Habits** | Observable recurring actions or cultural routines by staff and managers that embody principles, policies, and procedures in daily practice. Patterns reflect the lived reality of the HR system.                     | Anchors abstract ideals into lived experience. Behavioral patterns sustain organizational culture, reinforce legitimacy, and reveal where policies or procedures may fail to produce intended outcomes, enabling iterative improvement. |

| **Final Approval**                     | HR / PSC / Senior Authority                | HR ensures process compliance; PSC or ministry leadership may approve, but the superior’s input is critical in the decision.                                       |
| **Onboarding & Performance Alignment** | Superior + HR                              | The superior manages integration, team alignment, and initial performance objectives; HR manages formal induction and documentation.                               |

## QA

Is selecting, evaluating, and dismissing `administering the organization workforce (outside HR Unit)`, or is it administering the agents who execute the HR workflows?

- It fundamentally manages it's own agents - to execute HR Wrkflows.
- Proving as output the services of Selection, Dismissal, Evaluation,  Promotion, Re-Deployment, etc - proving resourers to be administer by a given organizational unit - this is not direclty administration - it's just a suplifer of subjects to be administer.

> **HRM** administers its own internal agents to deliver resources (employees, promotions, evaluations) that can then be administered by the operational units.
