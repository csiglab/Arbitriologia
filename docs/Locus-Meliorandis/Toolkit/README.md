# Action Toolkit

> Note: This is not a policy toolkit; this is our management toolkit; and the system or rather the ecosystem to be managed is called a **nation state**.

> Tools to Change Reality.

> General tools to model and analyze in [Locus Instrumentorum](../../Locus-Instrumentorum/README.md).

- Thinking: How to improve the national capacity for policy thinking to reduce mere imitation?
- Is the idea of a grand strategy useful? What exactly is a grand strategy, and does anyone truly have one?

## Action Typology

> or Hierarchy of Action.

> An agent is a recursive perception–action system capable of maintaining coherence between environmental sensing, internal modeling, and goal-directed action across multiple levels of abstraction.

> Higher levels stabilize, contextualize, and reinterpret lower ones; lower levels ground and actualize higher intentions.

| Level                | Description                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Meta-Strategy**    | Overarching vision, philosophy, or guiding principle that frames multiple strategies across contexts. Provides long-term orientation and coherence. |
| **Strategy**         | Coordinated plan to achieve long-term objectives. Defines broad approaches and priorities consistent with the meta-strategy.                        |
| **Policy Framework** | Organizing structure for policies; establishes principles, norms, and priorities that guide decision-making.                                        |
| **Policy**           | Formalized rules, guidelines, or constraints derived from strategy and the policy framework.                                                        |
| **Mechanism**        | The structural or procedural means through which policies are enacted; the “how” that ensures policies translate into concrete processes.           |
| **Tactic**           | Specific methods or approaches to implement policies or strategies. Short-term, adaptable, and context-sensitive.                                   |
| **Program**          | Coordinated set of projects or initiatives designed to achieve policy or strategic objectives. Focused on outcomes at an intermediate scale.        |
| **Scheme**           | Structured plan, design, or arrangement for a particular purpose, often bridging tactics and programs.                                              |
| **Project**          | Time-bound, resource-limited endeavor aimed at producing a defined deliverable within a scheme or program.                                          |
| **Action**           | Concrete, observable steps executed by agents to implement tactics, projects, or schemes. Ground-level realization of intent.                       |
