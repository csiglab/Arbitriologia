# The Collective Action Problem

> The **Collective Action Problem** denotes a systemic condition in which a group of agents attains a degree of reflexive awareness—recognizing, or at least meta-recognizing, the possibility of alternative social realities or developmental trajectories—yet remains unable to coordinate cognition and action toward their realization.

> Development consists in overcoming two interrelated systemic challenges: the «Agent–Social-Reality Hard Coupling Problem» and the «Collective Action Problem».

> A problem that is essentially part of the «Agent–Social-Reality Hard Coupling Problem» is identifying the “right” meta-theory of development—that is, the techno-productivist framework.
