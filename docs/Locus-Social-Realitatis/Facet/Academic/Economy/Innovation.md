| **Core Focus**          | Innovation processes—technological, organizational, and institutional—that generate new products, services, and methods.  |
| **Growth Driver**       | Economic growth is driven by **innovation**, not just capital accumulation or labor input.                                |
| **Role of Knowledge**   | Knowledge creation, diffusion, and learning are fundamental to productivity and long-term growth.                         |
| **Systems Perspective** | Innovation is embedded in networks of firms, universities, government agencies, and institutions (innovation ecosystems). |
| **Policy Implications** | Emphasizes active public policy to support R\&D, education, intellectual property rights, and infrastructure.             |
| **Dynamics**            | Focus on dynamic, path-dependent processes involving uncertainty, experimentation, and creative destruction.              |
| **Measurement**         | Goes beyond GDP, including patents, R\&D expenditure, technology adoption rates, and innovation outputs.                  |

| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Innovation Drives Long-Term Growth**       | Technological progress is the primary engine of sustained economic growth (Solow, Romer).            | Policy must focus on knowledge accumulation, R\&D, and human capital.                               |
| **Network Effects & Path Dependence Matter** | Innovation outcomes are shaped by early events and cumulative feedback (Arthur, David).              | Policy should aim to avoid lock-in and support diversity of technological options.                  |
| **Market Failures in Innovation**            | Innovation suffers from public goods issues, spillovers, and risk-aversion.                          | Justifies state intervention (e.g., subsidies, IP law, public R\&D).                                |
| **Systems of Innovation are Institutional**  | National and regional innovation systems depend on institutional complementarity (Lundvall, Nelson). | Policies must consider education systems, regulation, culture, and firm structure.                  |
| **Innovation is Nonlinear and Uncertain**    | Innovation does not follow a simple input-output model; it's exploratory and unpredictable.          | Evaluation must go beyond input metrics (e.g., R\&D spending) to include adaptability and feedback. |
| **Firm Heterogeneity Matters**               | Innovation capabilities differ significantly across firms, even in the same sector.                  | Targeted support and capability building are more effective than uniform policies.                  |
| **Knowledge Spillovers Are Crucial**         | Knowledge often flows beyond the innovating firm, benefiting others (Jaffe, Griliches).              | Clusters, universities, and open innovation platforms can amplify spillovers.                       |
| **Globalization Shapes Innovation Dynamics** | Global value chains and transnational networks redefine where and how innovation happens.            | National innovation policy must integrate with global dynamics and capabilities.                    |
| **Intellectual Property Has Dual Effects**   | IP can incentivize innovation but also restrict diffusion and cumulative innovation.                 | Balanced IP regimes are essential for dynamic innovation systems.                                   |
| **User-Driven & Open Innovation Emerge**     | Innovation is increasingly collaborative, involving users, communities, and networks (von Hippel).   | Traditional firm-centric models must adapt to more open and participatory modes of innovation.      |
