# Human

> A human is a member of the species Homo sapiens, a highly evolved primate distinguished by advanced cognitive abilities, upright posture, complex language, and the capacity for abstract thought, culture, and technology. Humans are social beings, capable of forming complex societies, creating institutions, and influencing their environment through tools and collective action.

> When born, one exists as a proto-human being—a repository of potentialities and developmental paths. One is not yet a “fully human” agent in terms of capacities, understanding, or self-realization. Thought, action, and social interaction gradually shape which potentials are realized, guiding the emergence of distinct modes of human existence. Over time, however, one can become locked into a particular mode of being, often reinforced by material constraints such as money. To explore different modes of human existence, one needs the courage to experiment and the ability to break free from limiting structures, pursuing a fuller range of human possibilities, so as to live one complete life rather than experiencing many small deaths along the way.

QA:

- What are the different modes of human being? What are the degrees of freedom of development?

- Is conceptualization necessary to distinguish specific modes of human existence, rather than merely acknowledging humanity in general?

## Social Capital

> Social Capital is a form of energy that gives rise to a society.

**Social Capital** refers to the value derived from individuals' social networks and connections. It encompasses the relationships, trust, and social norms between people and within communities.

**Social Capital** is a resource that individuals and communities can draw upon to achieve their goals, whether they are personal, social, or economic. It can manifest in different forms, such as social support, information sharing, and collaboration, and can be built through social activities such as volunteering, community involvement, and networking.

Some benefits of **social capital** include access to information and resources, increased social support, improved health outcomes, and more significant economic opportunities. On the other hand, a lack of social capital can result in social isolation, limited options, and increased vulnerability.

> Instead of **socializing capital**, it's about **capitalizing on the social**. Therefore, it's necessary to coordinate education and work, foster a new entrepreneurial culture, and drive science and technology forward.

## Human Capital

> **Human Capital** refers to the **aggregate stock of knowledge, skills, competencies, and attributes** possessed by individuals or groups that enable them to perform productive activities, innovate, and contribute to social and economic processes. It is both **an individual asset and a collective resource**, developed through education, training, experience, and health, and crucial for the functioning and advancement of social systems.

### Key Aspects

| **Aspect**              | **Explanation**                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Intangible Asset**    | Unlike physical capital, it consists of cognitive and embodied capacities.                  |
| **Investment-Driven**   | Accumulated through education, training, and socialization processes.                       |
| **Productivity Link**   | Enhances individuals’ and groups’ ability to generate economic value and social innovation. |
| **Social Embeddedness** | Developed and realized within social institutions, cultural contexts, and networks.         |
| **Dynamic**             | Subject to growth, depreciation, and renewal over time.                                     |
