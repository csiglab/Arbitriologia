# Coordinatio

> The coordination office should have `several` project coordinators;
>

Coordination Models:

- **Single-Lead Model**: One lab or principal investigator (PI) takes primary responsibility for the project and makes key decisions, with input from collaborating labs.
- **Co-Leadership Model**: Leadership is shared between two or more labs, with PIs collaborating on decision-making and oversight.
- **Steering Committee Model**: A committee composed of representatives from each participating **l**ab oversees the project and makes collective decisions.
- ***** + `Project Coordinator`:  A coordination model + an agent of the coordination department as the **principal coordinator and responsible for the project.**
